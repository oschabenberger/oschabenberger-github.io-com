## Aristotle and Lasswell {#sec-comm-models-aristotle}

There is no shortage of theoretical models for how communication takes place. One 
of the oldest models dates back to the fourth century BC and the Greek philosopher
Aristotle . Aristotle studied **rhetoric**, the art of persuasion.
What is called the **rhetorical situation** (@fig-rhet-sit) describes a triangle
between communicator (speaker), audience, and a subject that is conveyed.

![Aristotle's rhetorical situation](images/RhetoricalSituation.png){#fig-rhet-sit fig-align="center" width=80% .lightbox}

In modern times, the rhetorical situation was enhanced and embellished by acknowledging
that the context in which the communication takes place also matters. But the basic
structure remains the same: someone wants to persuade an audience with information (a subject).

A model with a linear structure that conveys related ideas is due to political 
scientist Harold Lasswell, who published a simple communication model in 1948 (@fig-lasswell).
The Lasswell model simply asks the question *Who Says What in What Channel to Whom and to 
What Effect?*


![Lasswell's model of communication](images/LasswellModel.png){#fig-lasswell fig-align="center" width=90% .lightbox}

Each question in the Lasswell model is assigned to its own field of inquiry. For example, 
the question *In What Channel?* is the topic of media analysis, the question *Says What?* 
is the topic of content analysis. Critics of the Lasswell model cite the lack of context,
and the linear structure that does not accommodate feedback. Like Aristotle's model,
it is simple enough for us to make progress with a theoretical understanding of
communication without getting bogged down in the minutiae.

The triangle in Aristotle's rhetorical situation is accompanied by the rhetorical
triangle in @fig-rhet-triangle. In order to be persuasive, communication must have
the three **appeals** in the figure. **Logos** appeals through facts and logical arguments, 
**ethos** through character and credibility of the speaker, and **pathos**
appeals through emotions. @KuchelRowland refers to the logos approach as "aiming 
for the head, not the heart" and the pathos approach as "aiming for the heart, 
not the head".


![Aristotle's rhetorical triangle](images/RhetoricalTriangle.png){#fig-rhet-triangle fig-align="center" width=80% .lightbox}

Effective communication does not necessarily have the three appeals in equal measure, 
but it has elements of all three appeals in some measure. We are not being 
influenced by a message if the information or the communicator lacks credibility. 
Unless we care about the subject and are willing to get emotionally engaged, the 
information falls flat. And information that does not make any sense is unlikely to be 
persuasive. 

In technical fields we tend to pay too much attention to Logos, thinking (or hoping) 
that information presented with logically sound arguments will automatically
stick and persuade. We have all come to know the dry and boring technical 
presentations delivered without passion and emotional appeal. Double-whammy if the presenter
does not have or does not establish credibility of the information or themselves and
delivers without personality. Attending a scientific conference one could conclude
that this style of presentation is so common; it is almost to be expected. it
does not have to be this way.


Communicating too much information that the audience cannot process and 
communicating too little information to make it worthwhile for the audience to 
pay attention ends up having the same effect: confusion (@fig-info-confusion).

Watch the following 3:28 minute video on presentation principles keeping in mind the
rhetorical triangle and the Lasswell model of communication.

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyTIGqvngMs
          title="Boring Presentation"
>}}

* Is the information presented logically sound?

* Is the presenter and the information credible?

* Are you emotionally engaged as a viewer?

Can you answer the questions in the Lasswell model: *Who says what in what
channel to whom to what effect?*

For the 3 1/2 minutes you spent with the video, did you get too little or too much
information about presentation principles?

How could the information be communicated more persuasively?
::::
:::

Speakers that are passionate about the subject are engaging and are more authentic
and believable compared to the dry, dispassionate communicator. A passionate
communicator makes themselves vulnerable by conveying their love for the subject.
This opening-up signal is received by the audience which in turn is allowed
to open up. The vulnerability loop, as it is called, is an effective tool to 
make connections and build trust---it presses emotional buttons. So do joy and laughing.

Emotional connections are powerful. As an example, take the following communication
by actor and comedian Jim Gaffigan. He repeats the same tweet (@fig-gaffigan-tweet)
on every anniversary of 9/11.

## Forms of Communication

Formally, we distinguish the following forms of communication:

- **Verbal**. Communicating through words, mostly spoken words (oral communication) 
- **Visual**. Involves the use of graphics, signs, video, and so on.
- **Written**. Conveying information in written form, whether it is an email,
letter, memo, contract, report, or text message. It is a form of verbal communication
because writing uses words. 
- **Nonverbal**. Communication without words, using body language, facial
expression, nonverbal cues, and so on.

We'd like to add another form of inter-personal communication that is often
overlooked and plays a critical role in today's society:

- **Listening**. In particular active listening with focus on the other person
and  intent to understand what they are trying to convey.

### Speaking, Visualizing, Writing

Imagine giving a presentation in a conference room to a group of business 
leaders. You are presenting for the data science team the results of the
latest A/B test experiments on website designs. The presentation will likely draw 
on several communication modes: you speak words, use visual aids to support your
points and to provide context, and written information the audience reads. 

Speaking, drawing (visualizing), and writing are the activities associated with 
verbal, visual, and written forms of communication. A presentation is a combination 
of these basic communication activities.

Some principles of communication, such as the rhetorical triangle, or the 
recommendation to strive for character, brevity, clarity, and honesty,
apply to all modes and forms of communication. They also have their specific principles and
challenges. Separate chapters in Part III, *Practice of Communication*, are 
dedicated to speaking, visualization (drawing), and writing. Here, we explore 
their relative importance in communicating content.

All humans and human groups have language itself or the capacity for language. 
The time when language developed varies by source but we can roughly say that
we communicated with language and diversified language about 100,000 years ago.
This is significant because it predates other modes of communication by tens of 
thousands of years 

![Storytelling around camp fire. Source: Stability AI (DreamStudio)](images/Cavemen_storytelling.png){#fig-cave-story fig-align="center" width=70% .lightbox}

After the invention of language, the next significant innovation in communication
was drawing. The first graphical depictions found in caves date back to about 
64,000 years ago. The first figurative cave drawing depicting a bovine was dated 
to about 40,000 years ago. In addition to transferring knowledge through oratory
we now used imagery to tell a story (@fig-cave-drawing). 

![Cave drawings. Source: [Encyclopaedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/art/cave-art#/media/1/100613/113927)](images/CaveDrawing.png){#fig-cave-drawing fig-align="center" width=70% .lightbox}

It took more than 35,000 years after that for the first writing to appear. One of
the oldest known writings is Sumerian cuneiform in the Kish tablet 
from about 3,500 BC (@fig-kish-tablet). The tablet depicts hands and feet, but 
also numbers. The pictography in early form of text shows its evolution
as a communication tool from drawing.

![The Kish Tablet. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_writing)](images/Tableta_con_trillo.png){#fig-kish-tablet fig-align="center" width="80%" .lightbox}

Among the more recent inventions in communication are newspapers, blogs, vlogs,
images, video, audio, text messages, email, Slack, and social media posts. And let us not
forget 1987: the first release of Microsoft PowerPoint. "Yes, and proud we are 
of all of them" (The Big Lebowski).

Why bother with all that in the context of team-based data science 
communication? 

Our brains are most wired for earlier forms of communication
and least wired for more recent forms. The most effective way of communicating
is by telling a story, as if you were sitting around a campfire, with the audience
focused entirely on the speaker. It is unlikely that you will communicate data
science ideas sitting around a fire---kudos if that happens to you and also, um,
get a life. However, by applying principles of storytelling, knowledge transfer 
to the audience is much more effective. These principles can be brought to bear
whether you deliver an extemporaneous speech, write an email to a collaborator,
or produce a visual essay.

---

After speaking, the second most effective means of communication is visually. 
Graphics, plots, and drawings are never *the* story themselves, but they
help you get the story across. Memorable communication supports spoken words
with visual appeal.

Less effective in presentations are written words. Although we have trained 
ourselves to consume information by reading, in the throws of a presentation 
we are more likely to connect with information we hear and see, than information
we read.

The Greek philosopher Plato, a student of Socrates and a teacher of Aristotle,
felt strongly about the power of oratory. In *Phaedrus*, Plato presents through
a dialog between his teacher Socrates and Phaedrus. His Socrates says

>*he who has knowledge of the just and the good and beautiful [...] will not, 
when in earnest, write them in ink, sowing them through a pen with words, 
which cannot defend themselves by argument and cannot teach the truth effectually*

and 

>*You know, Phaedrus, that is the strange thing about writing, which makes it 
truly correspond to painting. The painter’s products stand before us as though 
they were alive. But if you question them, they maintain a most majestic silence. 
It is the same with written words. They seem to talk to you as though they were 
intelligent, but if you ask them anything about what they say from a desire to 
be instructed they go on telling just the same thing forever.*

### Nonverbal Communication {#sec-theory-nonverbal}

Nonverbal communication are the ways in which we convey messages and information
by other means than speaking, visualizing, or writing. Examples of nonverbal
cues in communication include body language, facial expression, clothing, posture, 
eye contact, touch, loudness and tone of voice, use of space, movement, 
and nonverbal vocalizations such as sighing, scoffing, laughing, crying.


:::{.callout-note title="Personal Experience"}
One of the executives on the leadership team was known for their excessive nonverbal
contributions to meetings. While others were speaking, he would shake his head, sigh,
fidget uncomfortably in the chair, frown, scowl, scoff, and laugh under their breath. 
The nonverbal cues were meant to draw attention away from whoever was speaking,
to associate their contributions with negative emotions, and to show disapproval.

The popularity of the executive, which was not stellar to begin with, suffered
greatly from the nonverbal behavior. The support from the rest of the leadership
team eroded, which reduced the executive's effectiveness in the role. 
The rest, as they say, is history.

#### The 7\% myth

When forms of communication are discussed, you will encounter the percentages
55, 38, and 7\%. These refer to the importance of nonverbal body language (55\%), 
tone of voice (38\%), and the actual words spoken (7\%). Since tone of voice is
also nonverbal, these percentages would suggest that more than 90\% of communication
is nonverbal. Can this be true?

Think of reading the text of the Gettysburg address or Dr. Martin Luther King's
"I have a Dream" speech. Would we really grasp only 7\% of what the authors meant
if we have access to the words only?

Yes, nonverbal communication is important---extremely important, and its impact
is often under-estimated. The problem with the 55/38/7 numbers is that they apply
to a specific experiment and situation, when the verbal and nonverbal channels
**do not match**. If the attitude of the words we are speaking and the attitude we 
communicate through body language do not match, then the postural component 
dominates the attitude that is inferred. In other words, if your nonverbal
communication contradicts the message, the contradiction will win out. 


When someone yells "I am fine" while writhing in pain on the ground with a 
broken bone sticking out of their leg, we believe the nonverbal part of the 
communication. They are not fine.

The takeaways:

- Giving nonverbal cues that contradict the message will derail your communication.
- Nonverbal communication that supports the message is very important,
but it does not carry 90\% of the weight.

Here is an entertaining video about the importance of nonverbal communication.
Unfortunately, Dr. York perpetuates the myth that only 7\% of communication is
carried by the words we say.

#### The first impression

Thin-slicing is a term from psychology to describe finding patterns and 
shaping opinions based on a small amount of information, a thin slice of the
possibly available information. Research has shown that we are surprisingly good 
at thin-slicing, the attitudes formed based on small amounts of information are
often similar to those formed based on having access to more information.

Thin-slicing occurs when we first meet someone. We initially form opinions about 
them, taking a quick snapshot of who we think they are. In a study of TED talks,
discussed [here](https://blog.ted.com/body-language-survey-points-to-5-nonverbal-features-that-make-ted-talks-take-off/),
the authors investigated what makes some TED talks go viral while others get
many fewer views. After all, TED talks in general are great talks, with interesting
content delivered well rehearsed by credible speakers.

The research showed that we are thin-slicing speakers almost immediately based
on nonverbal cues. Are they credible and competent? Are they charismatic? 
Are they friendly? The sobering result is that opinions about the speaker, and 
by extension about the talk, were formed largely during the first seven seconds.
To test the result, the study compared the ratings of audiences who watched only
the first seven seconds of the talk and those who watched the full talk. Which 
speakers and talks the audiences overall liked and disliked matched. As soon
as the person takes the stage we thin-slide and form an opinion "I think I am
going to like this talk".

Here are a few other fascinating results from the study of TED talks:

1. **It's not what you say, it's how you say it**. Audiences who watched the 
speakers on mute rated the talks almost exactly with respect to overall rating, 
speaker intelligence, charisma, and credibility as audiences who watched the
talk with sound

2. **More hand gestures is better**. The popularity of the talk increased with 
the number of hand gestures a speaker makes.  

3. **Scripts kill your charisma**". Talks are rated higher when the speaker shows
more vocal variability. Working with scripts or teleprompters works against 
variety in vocal impressions. Also, ad-libbing is rated higher than staying on
script.

4. **Smiling makes you look smarter**. The more speakers smiled, the higher their
perceived intelligence rating.

@sec-nonverbal.

## The Audience

Confronted with communication the audience has three choices: ignore it, 
engage with it, or respond to it [@Longnecker]. Being ignored is not what you
are after when communicating. To increase engagement and response, you must 
consider the audience. Who are you communicating to? What are their background,
circumstances and motivation? What is their interest level? Why would they care?

All audiences are comprised of individuals and it helps to imagine what the 
average audience member is like as well as the variability among them. The checklist
in @Longnecker includes asking yourself the following questions about audience
members

- What are their relevant values and beliefs?
- Do they have existing awareness and attitudes about the topic?
- Will they be receptive to the information?
- What is their knowledge about the topic?
- Will they have the skills, resources, and support to act upon the information?

:::{.callout-tip title="Personal Experience"}
As chief technology officer (CTO) of a technology company I was often asked about 
emerging technologies and what they meant for our business, for our customers, or 
for society in general. Cognitive computing, deep learning, internet of things, 
artificial intelligence, blockchain, quantum computing, NoSQL databases are 
some of the topics I had to speak to.

When preparing for those conversations it was helpful to imagine four archetypes
of audience members:

1. **My mother**. How would you explain the topic to someone with limited technical 
knowledge---sorry, mom. The goal of the communication is to convey the basics of the 
technology and anchor it correctly to her view of the world.

2. **A media reporter**. Charged with having to produce material on the topic, 
I want to inform them and convey a position if necessary. There is limited opportunity 
to ask questions, for example to establish their knowledge level, and limited time
of engagement. What is the quotable sentence that they will write down, record,
and reproduce?

3. **An industry analyst**. These folks tend to have (strong) opinions on everything
although they have limited time to learn and grasp new technologies. Tech evolves
more quickly for anyone to become expert on all aspects of the technology in a 
given field. If the analyst has already formed an opinion about a tech topic I want
to convey my view and establish how they differ or agree---and why.

4. **A technical expert**. Talking to someone who knows much more about the topic
than myself, I want the time they spend with me on the subject to be valuable to 
both sides. The goal is to learn something and at the same time not to waste their
time. Communication has to establish for the benefit of the expert the depth of 
my understanding so they can build on that foundation.

Example: Blockchain Technology

1. Blockchain is a type of database technology that allows the secure sharing
of information, for example financial transactions.

2. Blockchain is essentially an append-only ledger that is made secure by 
distributing copies of the ledger across a network. This makes it difficult to
tamper with the information as one would have to modify all copies of the ledger.
Blockchain is not an application, but can be the backbone of the next generation
of applications on the internet.

3. We can view blockchain as another form of distributed database technology, but
that would not do justice to most distributed databases. As an append-only system
it is fairly simple. The more important question in my opinion is which applications
will be built on blockchain technology. As in other areas such as the Internet of
Things (IoT), it is rather difficult to replace incumbent approaches that are 
only somewhat broken. I expect blockchain technology to be most successful in 
new application areas where safe, distributed transactions are key. For example,
rather than replacing the SWIFT international payment system, blockchain can 
help build systems for micropayments for online content creators.

4. My motivation to examine blockchain technology is from the standpoint of
building applications for cryptographically safe transactions. While the distributed
nature of the chain helps to provide security, I am wondering whether that
feature inhibits applications where transaction speed is also essential. I am 
curious about your views on tradeoffs with blockchain technology.

There are other ways to categorize audiences that can be helpful in tailoring
communication. For example, by their interest level.

* **Interested and appreciative**. An easy audience to communicate to; the members
are motivated and often self-selected. Giving a talk at a scientific conference
to like-minded "birds of a feather" or hanging out with other data scientists
is where you can find such an audience.

* **Uninterested**. You need to motivate the audience in order to engage with
your communication. What is in it for them, how can you make the information
relevant for them?

* **Skeptical or polarized**. Imagine giving a talk about climate change,
immigration, or vaccination to a randomly chosen audience. The audience members
will typically be interested in the topic but with firmly held beliefs. What
are the barriers that need to be overcome to perceive information that might
be at odds with their beliefs? Successful communication aligns with the values
of the audience. In audiences that are misaligned with the communicator or 
that exhibit diversity in values and beliefs, communication is more challenging.
Mindful communication that considers different perspectives is more effective
than patronizing communication.


## The Curse of Knowledge {#sec-curse-knowledge}

### Tappers and Listeners

@Heath2007 describe an experiment at Stanford University in the 1990s by Ph.D.
student Elizabeth Newton where subjects were assigned to two roles. 
A **tapper** was asked to chose a song from a list of 
well-known tunes---think "Star Spangled Banner" or Happy Birthday to You". 
They then tapped the rhythm of the tune to a **listener** who had to guess the 
song based on the rhythm.

It turns out that listeners guessed correctly only 3 of 120 tapped songs, a
paltry 2.5\% success rate. Yet when the tappers were asked to predict the 
chance that listeners would identify the tune, they guessed a 50\% success rate.

This phenomenon is known as the **curse of knowledge** or the **expert's curse**.

A knowledgeable person has a difficult time to reconstruct what a person lacking
that knowledge would think. If you are better informed, it is difficult to 
correctly anticipate the judgement of lesser informed people. The tappers had
knowledge of the song they were tapping out, literally having it play in their
head. Knowing what the outcome of the experiment ought to be---I am tapping 
"Happy Birthday to You"---made the outcome in the tapper's mind more predictable
than it actually was. The poor listeners did not have access to that information
and had to reconstruct the tune from only the rhythmic tapping. 

We have a strong tendency to unknowingly assume that others know what we know 
or that it would be easier to learn it than it actually is or that others
can learn concepts in the same way that the concepts make sense to us now.

### IRL (In Real Life)

This experiment plays out in real life millions of times every day. 

When a university professor teaches expectations of random variables they do it 
armed with the  knowledge of hundreds of applications and mathematical tricks 
an experienced statistician brings to bear. That is the tune in their head; 
they cannot imagine the state of their own mind before they first learned about 
expected values. The curse of knowledge is also at play when you ask a teacher
whether the students are learning. The way the teacher conveys material, based
on already knowing it, may not be best for those who lack the teacher's knowledge.

When a software engineer writes documentation for the features of the latest
product release, they are equipped with deep inside knowledge about the software.
They have a difficult time imagining what it is like for a user to 
experience the software for the first time. Software user interfaces that 
are intuitive to the engineer who developed it but are counterintuitive and 
complicated for everyone else are an example where the curse of knowledge clouds
the judgment.

A company executive cannot unlearn what they know about the nature and conventions
of the business. When crafting communications to employees they cannot imagine
what it is like not knowing the ins and outs of market capitalization or 
maximizing shareholder value.

A data scientist presents to company executives the result of developing over
the last three months a new customer churn model based on data collected from 
the nascent SaaS (Software as a Service) business of the company. The data scientist
knows the ins and outs of the data used for model development as well as the 
pros and cons of the considered models. Because the various models had tradeoffs
the ultimate churn prediction is based on a heterogeneous ensemble of models
from four families. In the presentation the data scientist assumes that the 
executives are familiar with customer data from SaaS business because he 
is very familiar with it. The executives cannot relate to the input or output
of the work and cancel the project.

Using statistical jargon that the audience is unfamiliar with is another 
example of the curse of knowledge. Can you imagine how a brain processes the
information that is not trained in significance levels, learning rates, or
cross-entropy loss?

Knowing your audience means putting yourself into the frame of mind of 
someone without the expert knowledge you bring to the conversation. In order
to be effective at transferring knowledge, you need to know what the vessel
you are transferring knowledge into looks like.


### What Can Be Done About It?


How can we alleviate the effects of the curse of knowledge?

The first piece of advice is to have **empathy** for your audience but that is easier
said than done. Empathy is often described as "walking in someone else's shoes", 
"seeing the world through someone else's eyes". As Brené Brown instructs, 
you cannot put on some magic glasses and lens the world through someone else's eyes. 
You cannot walk in someone else's shoes. Empathy means to acknowledge that 
someone has **different** experiences and views from yours. Rather than trying to
walk in someone else's shoes, empathy is about acknowledging that those shoes
exists---and that they do not fit your feet. 

Fighting the curse of knowledge through empathy is a great start. While it is
valuable to acknowledge that the less knowledgeable state of mind is different
from ours, we are limited by not being very good at figuring out what exactly
the less knowledgeable state of mind looks like---in the audience and in ourselves.

As communicators we also need to have **empathy for ourselves**, as we were in the 
less knowledgeable state before we became experts at the topic we are communicating.
Unfortunately, we are also not good in empathizing with our past selves in 
less knowledgeable states. This inability stems from being anchored in a state 
of mind full of hindsight created by the receipt of knowledge [@Fischhoff].

In preparing material, ask for **feedback**. What resonated with the audience? 
What did they not understand? Reread your own material after some time. If it 
is not clear what you meant by something or why you wrote a passage the way you
did, how can you assume that the audience will understand what you meant?

Software engineers experience this phenomenon the hard way when they do not
document code when they write it. At the time, it is perfectly clear to them how 
the code works and why it is written the way it is. Six months removed from it
they wonder what in the world this code is supposed to do, how it works, and 
who wrote it.

The next piece of advice to defeat the curse of knowledge is to use **concrete and
relatable language** to describe complex things. Avoid abstract language and jargon.
Use analogies (something is like something else, "life is like a box of chocolates") 
and metaphors (compare two things directly, "time is money") to communicate 
complex topics. Metaphors and analogies make the unfamiliar seem familiar, they
ease the audience into a topic, break down barriers, and provide a comforting
baseline understanding. 

Rather than trying to figure out what you meant 
by *random error*, referring to *noise in the system* allows the audience to 
connect a statistical concept to real-life concept and to follow along.
**Unstructured data** can turn into **doctor's notes** or **online buzz**.
**Nonlinear optimization** can become **finding**, a **neural network**
is **somewhat brain-like**. For more practical advice
on using metaphors and analogies, see @sec-metaphors.
