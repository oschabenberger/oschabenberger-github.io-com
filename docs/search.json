    "text": "Hard Skills and Soft Skills\nWe like to divide people’s abilities to apply knowledge into hard and soft skills.\nThe former are the things related to a particular subject matter domain, the technical skills you need to do the job. A statistician needs to be skilled in mathematics and probability. A carpenter needs to be skilled at turning plans into structures using woodworking tools. A front-end programmer needs to be skilled at building web sites and user interfaces. These are the skills you learn when you study a subject.\nSoft skills, on the other hand, appear to refer to character and personality traits, the things that motivate us to behave a certain way. Any list of soft skills lists items such as problem solving, time management, empathy, work ethic, adaptability, and leadership skills. And the one soft skill that is on every list: communication.\nI do not subscribe to this categorization of skills in two buckets, for a number of reasons.\n\nSoft skills are not really soft. This is the hard stuff. Ask folks what they are struggling with. Ask employers about skills most lacking in new employees. They will cite communication, time management, problem solving, teamwork, and so on. Public speaking is among the greatest phobias, ranking ahead of zombies and spiders. 25% of Americans say that they prefer to avoid speaking in front of people.\nTo describe soft skills as character traits suggests that they are innate—you either are a good communicator or you are not. You either are a leader or you are not. You can manage your time or you cannot. That is simply not true. These are skills—just that. You can study them, learn them and get better at them.\nEducation is focused on technical skills and domain expertise. It is difficult enough to convey those skills in the time available in any educational program. Most educators would prefer to teach material from their area of expertise. In technical fields, educators teach technical stuff. Most educators agree that we need to convey more than technical information.\n\n\nIf soft skills are important, you are somehow supposed to learn them along the way—by some form of osmosis. Having a class schedule with homework and exams might improve your time management skills. Participating in experiential learning activities might improve your problem solving skills. Presenting research at conferences might improve your communication skills. After attending many conferences and scientific talks, I am convinced that repetition alone does not elevate the quality of scientific presentations.\nWhen it comes to communication and operating in a team-based data science environment, we favor a different approach. You can be a good data scientist without strong communication skills. But you cannot be a great data scientist without. You can be a good data scientist working by yourself, but you cannot be a great data scientist without understanding team dynamics and being a leader and/or contributor to teams.\nWe treat these skills not as soft, but as human skills necessary to do the job you are training for well. It is a topic that requires systematic study and practice. It has to be a formal part of the data science curriculum.",

    "text": "Communication in Data Science\nWhy is it so important to have excellent communication skills in data science?\n\nData science is a team sport. Even if you are the only data scientist in your organization, you are connecting and collaborating with people from other units. The problems you work on are often complex and require cross-organizational, cross-disciplinary teams. Since so many problems involve data, the data scientist is a full member or partner of the team. What matters ultimately is not the data science itself, but the impact of the total effort. Communication facilitates effective collaboration and team work.\nOur subject is technical and inherently difficult to understand. Data science requires technical knowledge in statistics, mathematics, and programming. Those are nerdy subjects full of technical jargon. The audience of data science is mostly non-technical and quick to remind you that those were their least favorite subjects in school or college.\nA data science project involves translation: a business problem, research, or policy question is translated into an application involving data. If the project is successful, the assets produced by the data science team are translated into a business, research, or policy solution and hopefully implemented. You need to be able to converse in multiple languages: the language of the client, the language of the data, the language of the IT department, the language of the business, and so on.\nDecision makers turn to data science for data-driven decisions. The decision rules and criteria applied during the core data science investigation and at the business or executive level are very different. How does a small \\(p\\)-value for an input variable in a marketing lead scoring model translate into whether the sales revenue will increase in the next quarter? In order to influence and effect change, the audience needs to comprehend the impact of your work in their decision framework.\nData literacy, the ability to understand and communicate data, is not as developed as we would like. Numbers and figures have an air of authority and can bring about a suspension of critical thinking. The data scientist should increase data literacy by improving interpretation, understanding, and thinking about data.\nOur subject is uncertainty. Data is inherently uncertain and statistical assets are uncertain as a result. The models we develop are useful abstractions and not foolproof. Predictions can be off, classifications can be incorrect. Communicating about an uncertain subject in certain terms is difficult.\n\n\nA great data scientist is a leader because they influence and inspire. Leadership does not come automatically with title and you do not need a title to be a leader. In the spirit of Simon Sinek, if you raise your shield to protect the person to your right and the person to your left, you are a leader. If you inspire others and influence their thinking and actions, you are a leader. You do not have to be in the role of decision maker to be a leader. It is the human skills such as connection, communication, empathy, and emotional intelligence that give you the power to transcend rank and to inspire and influence.\nChurch (2023) summarizes as follows\n\nBy communicating effectively, data scientists can ensure that their work aligns with business goals, that they are working on the most impactful problems, that they collaborate successfully with others, that they present results and insights effectively, and that they ultimately influence decisions and actions.",

    "text": "1.1 Aristotle and Lasswell\nThere is no shortage of theoretical models for how communication takes place. One of the oldest models dates back to the fourth century BC and the Greek philosopher Aristotle . Aristotle studied rhetoric, the art of persuasion. What is called the rhetorical situation (Figure 1.1) describes a triangle between communicator (speaker), audience, and a subject that is conveyed.\nIn modern times, the rhetorical situation was enhanced and embellished by acknowledging that the context in which the communication takes place also matters. But the basic structure remains the same: someone wants to persuade an audience with information (a subject).\nA model with a linear structure that conveys related ideas is due to political scientist Harold Lasswell, who published a simple communication model in 1948 (Figure 1.2). The Lasswell model simply asks the question Who Says What in What Channel to Whom and to What Effect?\nEach question in the Lasswell model is assigned to its own field of inquiry. For example, the question In What Channel? is the topic of media analysis, the question Says What? is the topic of content analysis. Critics of the Lasswell model cite the lack of context, and the linear structure that does not accommodate feedback. Like Aristotle’s model, it is simple enough for us to make progress with a theoretical understanding of communication without getting bogged down in the minutiae.\nThe triangle in Aristotle’s rhetorical situation is accompanied by the rhetorical triangle in Figure 1.3. In order to be persuasive, communication must have the three appeals in the figure. Logos appeals through facts and logical arguments, ethos through character and credibility of the speaker, and pathos appeals through emotions. Kuchel and Rowland (2023) refers to the logos approach as “aiming for the head, not the heart” and the pathos approach as “aiming for the heart, not the head”.\nEffective communication does not necessarily have the three appeals in equal measure, but it has elements of all three appeals in some measure. We are not being influenced by a message if the information or the communicator lacks credibility. Unless we care about the subject and are willing to get emotionally engaged, the information falls flat. And information that does not make any sense is unlikely to be persuasive.\nIn technical fields we tend to pay too much attention to Logos, thinking (or hoping) that information presented with logically sound arguments will automatically stick and persuade. We have all come to know the dry and boring technical presentations delivered without passion and emotional appeal. Double-whammy if the presenter does not have or does not establish credibility of the information or themselves and delivers without personality. Attending a scientific conference one could conclude that this style of presentation is so common; it is almost to be expected. it does not have to be this way.\nCommunicating too much information that the audience cannot process and communicating too little information to make it worthwhile for the audience to pay attention ends up having the same effect: confusion (Figure 1.4).\nSpeakers that are passionate about the subject are engaging and are more authentic and believable compared to the dry, dispassionate communicator. A passionate communicator makes themselves vulnerable by conveying their love for the subject. This opening-up signal is received by the audience which in turn is allowed to open up. The vulnerability loop, as it is called, is an effective tool to make connections and build trust—it presses emotional buttons. So do joy and laughing.\nEmotional connections are powerful. As an example, take the following communication by actor and comedian Jim Gaffigan. He repeats the same tweet (Figure 1.5) on every anniversary of 9/11.",

    "section": "1.2 Forms of Communication",
    "text": "1.2 Forms of Communication\nFormally, we distinguish the following forms of communication:\n\nVerbal. Communicating through words, mostly spoken words (oral communication)\nVisual. Involves the use of graphics, signs, video, and so on.\nWritten. Conveying information in written form, whether it is an email, letter, memo, contract, report, or text message. It is a form of verbal communication because writing uses words.\nNonverbal. Communication without words, using body language, facial expression, nonverbal cues, and so on.\n\nWe’d like to add another form of inter-personal communication that is often overlooked and plays a critical role in today’s society:\n\nListening. In particular active listening with focus on the other person and intent to understand what they are trying to convey.\n\n\nSpeaking, Visualizing, Writing\nImagine giving a presentation in a conference room to a group of business leaders. You are presenting for the data science team the results of the latest A/B test experiments on website designs. The presentation will likely draw on several communication modes: you speak words, use visual aids to support your points and to provide context, and written information the audience reads.\nSpeaking, drawing (visualizing), and writing are the activities associated with verbal, visual, and written forms of communication. A presentation is a combination of these basic communication activities.\nSome principles of communication, such as the rhetorical triangle, or the recommendation to strive for character, brevity, clarity, and honesty, apply to all modes and forms of communication. They also have their specific principles and challenges. Separate chapters in Part III, Practice of Communication, are dedicated to speaking, visualization (drawing), and writing. Here, we explore their relative importance in communicating content.\nAll humans and human groups have language itself or the capacity for language. The time when language developed varies by source but we can roughly say that we communicated with language and diversified language about 100,000 years ago. This is significant because it predates other modes of communication by tens of thousands of years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Storytelling around camp fire. Source: Stability AI (DreamStudio)\n\n\n\nAfter the invention of language, the next significant innovation in communication was drawing. The first graphical depictions found in caves date back to about 64,000 years ago. The first figurative cave drawing depicting a bovine was dated to about 40,000 years ago. In addition to transferring knowledge through oratory we now used imagery to tell a story (Figure 1.7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Cave drawings. Source: Encyclopaedia Britannica\n\n\n\nIt took more than 35,000 years after that for the first writing to appear. One of the oldest known writings is Sumerian cuneiform in the Kish tablet from about 3,500 BC (Figure 1.8). The tablet depicts hands and feet, but also numbers. The pictography in early form of text shows its evolution as a communication tool from drawing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: The Kish Tablet. Source: Wikipedia\n\n\n\nAmong the more recent inventions in communication are newspapers, blogs, vlogs, images, video, audio, text messages, email, Slack, and social media posts. And let us not forget 1987: the first release of Microsoft PowerPoint. “Yes, and proud we are of all of them” (The Big Lebowski).\nWhy bother with all that in the context of team-based data science communication?\nOur brains are most wired for earlier forms of communication and least wired for more recent forms. The most effective way of communicating is by telling a story, as if you were sitting around a campfire, with the audience focused entirely on the speaker. It is unlikely that you will communicate data science ideas sitting around a fire—kudos if that happens to you and also, um, get a life. However, by applying principles of storytelling, knowledge transfer to the audience is much more effective. These principles can be brought to bear whether you deliver an extemporaneous speech, write an email to a collaborator, or produce a visual essay.\n\nAfter speaking, the second most effective means of communication is visually. Graphics, plots, and drawings are never the story themselves, but they help you get the story across. Memorable communication supports spoken words with visual appeal.\nLess effective in presentations are written words. Although we have trained ourselves to consume information by reading, in the throws of a presentation we are more likely to connect with information we hear and see, than information we read.\nThe Greek philosopher Plato, a student of Socrates and a teacher of Aristotle, felt strongly about the power of oratory. In Phaedrus, Plato presents through a dialog between his teacher Socrates and Phaedrus. His Socrates says\n\nhe who has knowledge of the just and the good and beautiful […] will not, when in earnest, write them in ink, sowing them through a pen with words, which cannot defend themselves by argument and cannot teach the truth effectually\n\nand\n\nYou know, Phaedrus, that is the strange thing about writing, which makes it truly correspond to painting. The painter’s products stand before us as though they were alive. But if you question them, they maintain a most majestic silence. It is the same with written words. They seem to talk to you as though they were intelligent, but if you ask them anything about what they say from a desire to be instructed they go on telling just the same thing forever.\n\n\n\nNonverbal Communication\nNonverbal communication are the ways in which we convey and receive messages and information by other means than speaking, visualizing, or writing. Nonverbal communication is both intentional and unintentional, many speakers are not aware of some of the nonverbal cues that enhance or detract from the message.\nExamples of nonverbal cues in communication include body language, facial expression, clothing, posture, eye contact, touch, loudness and tone of voice, use of space, movement, smell, and nonverbal vocalizations such as sighing, scoffing, laughing, crying. Nonverbal messages are also produced by the overall setting, for example, use of space, time, and silence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Experience\n\n\n\nOne of the executives on the leadership team was known for their excessive nonverbal contributions to meetings. While others were speaking, he would shake his head, sigh, fidget uncomfortably in the chair, frown, scowl, scoff, and laugh under their breath. The nonverbal cues were meant to draw attention away from whoever was speaking, to associate their contributions with negative emotions, and to show disapproval.\nThe popularity of the executive, which was not stellar to begin with, suffered greatly from the nonverbal behavior. The support from the rest of the leadership team eroded, which reduced the executive’s effectiveness in the role. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\n\n\nThe 7% myth\nWhen forms of communication are discussed, you will encounter the percentages 55, 38, and 7%. These refer to the importance of nonverbal body language (55%), tone of voice (38%), and the actual words spoken (7%). Since tone of voice is also nonverbal, these percentages would suggest that more than 90% of communication is nonverbal. Can this be true?\nThink of reading the text of the Gettysburg address or Dr. Martin Luther King’s “I have a Dream” speech. Would we really grasp only 7% of what the authors meant if we have access to the words only?\nYes, nonverbal communication is important—extremely important, and its impact is often under-estimated. The problem with the 55/38/7 numbers is that they apply to a specific experiment and situation, when the verbal and nonverbal channels do not match. If the attitude of the words we are speaking and the attitude we communicate through body language do not match, then the postural component dominates the attitude that is inferred. In other words, if your nonverbal communication contradicts the message, the contradiction will win out.\nWhen someone yells “I am fine” while writhing in pain on the ground with a broken bone sticking out of their leg, we believe the nonverbal part of the communication. They are not fine.\nThe takeaways:\n\nGiving nonverbal cues that contradict the message will derail your communication.\nNonverbal communication that supports the message is very important, but it does not carry 90% of the weight.\n\nHere is an entertaining video about the importance of nonverbal communication. Unfortunately, Dr. York perpetuates the myth that only 7% of communication is carried by the words we say.\n\n\n\nThe first impression\nThin-slicing is a term from psychology to describe finding patterns and shaping opinions based on a small amount of information, a thin slice of the possibly available information. Research has shown that we are surprisingly good at thin-slicing, the attitudes formed based on small amounts of information are often similar to those formed based on having access to more information.\nThin-slicing occurs when we first meet someone. We initially form opinions about them, taking a quick snapshot of who we think they are. In a study of TED talks, discussed here, the authors investigated what makes some TED talks go viral while others get many fewer views. After all, TED talks in general are great talks, with interesting content delivered by well rehearsed and credible speakers.\nThe research showed that we are thin-slicing speakers almost immediately based on nonverbal cues. Are they credible and competent? Are they charismatic? Are they friendly? The sobering result is that opinions about the speaker, and by extension about the talk, were formed largely during the first seven seconds. To test the result, the study compared the ratings of audiences who watched only the first seven seconds of the talk and those who watched the full talk. Which speakers and talks the audiences overall liked and disliked matched. As soon as the person takes the stage we thin-slice and form an opinion “I think I am going to like this talk”.\nHere are a few other fascinating results from the study of TED talks:\n\nIt’s not what you say, it’s how you say it. Audiences who watched the speakers on mute rated the talks almost exactly with respect to overall rating, speaker intelligence, charisma, and credibility as audiences who watched the talk with sound\nMore hand gestures is better. The popularity of the talk increased with the number of hand gestures a speaker makes.\nScripts kill your charisma”. Talks are rated higher when the speaker shows more vocal variability. Working with scripts or teleprompters works against variety in vocal impressions. Also, ad-libbing is rated higher than staying on script.\nSmiling makes you look smarter. The more speakers smiled, the higher their perceived intelligence rating.\n\nMore on the Do’s and Do Not’s of nonverbal cues in practicing communication in Chapter 8.",

    "section": "1.3 The Audience",
    "text": "1.3 The Audience\nConfronted with communication the audience has three choices: ignore it, engage with it, or respond to it (Longnecker 2023). Being ignored is not what you are after when communicating. To increase engagement and response, you must consider the audience. Who are you communicating to? What are their background, circumstances and motivation? What is their interest level? Why would they care?\nAll audiences are comprised of individuals and it helps to imagine what the average audience member is like as well as the variability among them. The checklist in Longnecker (2023) includes asking yourself the following questions about audience members\n\nWhat are their relevant values and beliefs?\nDo they have existing awareness and attitudes about the topic?\nWill they be receptive to the information?\nWhat is their knowledge about the topic?\nWill they have the skills, resources, and support to act upon the information?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Experience\n\n\n\nAs chief technology officer (CTO) of a technology company I was often asked about emerging technologies and what they meant for our business, for our customers, or for society in general. Cognitive computing, deep learning, internet of things, artificial intelligence, blockchain, quantum computing, NoSQL databases are some of the topics I had to speak to.\nWhen preparing for those conversations it was helpful to imagine four archetypes of audience members:\n\nMy mother. How would you explain the topic to someone with limited technical knowledge—sorry, mom. The goal of the communication is to convey the basics of the technology and anchor it correctly to her view of the world.\nA media reporter. Charged with having to produce material on the topic, I want to inform them and convey a position if necessary. There is limited opportunity to ask questions, for example to establish their knowledge level, and limited time of engagement. What is the quotable sentence that they will write down, record, and reproduce?\nAn industry analyst. These folks tend to have (strong) opinions on everything although they have limited time to learn and grasp new technologies. Tech evolves more quickly for anyone to become expert on all aspects of the technology in a given field. If the analyst has already formed an opinion about a tech topic I want to convey my view and establish how they differ or agree—and why.\nA technical expert. Talking to someone who knows much more about the topic than myself, I want the time they spend with me on the subject to be valuable to both sides. The goal is to learn something and at the same time not to waste their time. Communication has to establish for the benefit of the expert the depth of my understanding so they can build on that foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Blockchain Technology\n\n\n\nBlockchain is a type of database technology that allows the secure sharing of information, for example financial transactions.\nBlockchain is essentially an append-only ledger that is made secure by distributing copies of the ledger across a network. This makes it difficult to tamper with the information as one would have to modify all copies of the ledger. Blockchain is not an application, but can be the backbone of the next generation of applications on the internet.\nWe can view blockchain as another form of distributed database technology, but that would not do justice to most distributed databases. As an append-only system it is fairly simple. The more important question in my opinion is which applications will be built on blockchain technology. As in other areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT), it is rather difficult to replace incumbent approaches that are only somewhat broken. I expect blockchain technology to be most successful in new application areas where safe, distributed transactions are key. For example, rather than replacing the SWIFT international payment system, blockchain can help build systems for micropayments for online content creators.\nMy motivation to examine blockchain technology is from the standpoint of building applications for cryptographically safe transactions. While the distributed nature of the chain helps to provide security, I am wondering whether that feature inhibits applications where transaction speed is also essential. I am curious about your views on tradeoffs with blockchain technology.\n\n\n\nThere are other ways to categorize audiences that can be helpful in tailoring communication. For example, by their interest level.\n\nInterested and appreciative. An easy audience to communicate to; the members are motivated and often self-selected. Giving a talk at a scientific conference to like-minded “birds of a feather” or hanging out with other data scientists is where you can find such an audience.\nUninterested. You need to motivate the audience in order to engage with your communication. What is in it for them, how can you make the information relevant for them?\nSkeptical or polarized. Imagine giving a talk about climate change, immigration, or vaccination to a randomly chosen audience. The audience members will typically be interested in the topic but with firmly held beliefs. What are the barriers that need to be overcome to perceive information that might be at odds with their beliefs? Successful communication aligns with the values of the audience. In audiences that are misaligned with the communicator or that exhibit diversity in values and beliefs, communication is more challenging. Mindful communication that considers different perspectives is more effective than patronizing communication.",

    "section": "1.4 The Curse of Knowledge",
    "text": "1.4 The Curse of Knowledge\n\nTappers and Listeners\nHeath and Heath (2007) describe an experiment at Stanford University in the 1990s by Ph.D. student Elizabeth Newton where subjects were assigned to two roles. A tapper was asked to chose a song from a list of well-known tunes—think “Star Spangled Banner” or Happy Birthday to You”. They then tapped the rhythm of the tune to a listener who had to guess the song based on the rhythm.\nIt turns out that listeners guessed correctly only 3 of 120 tapped songs, a paltry 2.5% success rate. Yet when the tappers were asked to predict the chance that listeners would identify the tune, they guessed a 50% success rate.\nThis phenomenon is known as the curse of knowledge or the expert’s curse.\nA knowledgeable person has a difficult time to reconstruct what a person lacking that knowledge would think. If you are better informed, it is difficult to correctly anticipate the judgement of lesser informed people. The tappers had knowledge of the song they were tapping out, literally having it play in their head. Knowing what the outcome of the experiment ought to be—I am tapping “Happy Birthday to You”—made the outcome in the tapper’s mind more predictable than it actually was. The poor listeners did not have access to that information and had to reconstruct the tune from only the rhythmic tapping.\nWe have a strong tendency to unknowingly assume that others know what we know or that it would be easier to learn it than it actually is or that others can learn concepts in the same way that the concepts make sense to us now.\n\n\nIRL (In Real Life)\nThis experiment plays out in real life millions of times every day.\nWhen a university professor teaches expectations of random variables they do it armed with the knowledge of hundreds of applications and mathematical tricks an experienced statistician brings to bear. That is the tune in their head; they cannot imagine the state of their own mind before they first learned about expected values. The curse of knowledge is also at play when you ask a teacher whether the students are learning. The way the teacher conveys material, based on already knowing it, may not be best for those who lack the teacher’s knowledge.\nWhen a software engineer writes documentation for the features of the latest product release, they are equipped with deep inside knowledge about the software. They have a difficult time imagining what it is like for a user to experience the software for the first time. Software user interfaces that are intuitive to the engineer who developed it but are counterintuitive and complicated for everyone else are an example where the curse of knowledge clouds the judgment.\nA company executive cannot unlearn what they know about the nature and conventions of the business. When crafting communications to employees they cannot imagine what it is like not knowing the ins and outs of market capitalization or maximizing shareholder value.\nA data scientist presents to company executives the result of developing over the last three months a new customer churn model based on data collected from the nascent SaaS (Software as a Service) business of the company. The data scientist knows the ins and outs of the data used for model development as well as the pros and cons of the considered models. Because the various models had tradeoffs the ultimate churn prediction is based on a heterogeneous ensemble of models from four families. In the presentation the data scientist assumes that the executives are familiar with customer data from SaaS business because he is very familiar with it. The executives cannot relate to the input or output of the work and cancel the project.\nUsing statistical jargon that the audience is unfamiliar with is another example of the curse of knowledge. Can you imagine how a brain processes the information that is not trained in significance levels, learning rates, or cross-entropy loss?\nKnowing your audience means putting yourself into the frame of mind of someone without the expert knowledge you bring to the conversation. In order to be effective at transferring knowledge, you need to know what the vessel you are transferring knowledge into looks like.\n\n\nWhat Can Be Done About It?\nHow can we alleviate the effects of the curse of knowledge?\nThe first piece of advice is to have empathy for your audience but that is easier said than done. Empathy is often described as “walking in someone else’s shoes”, “seeing the world through someone else’s eyes”. As Brené Brown instructs, you cannot put on some magic glasses and lens the world through someone else’s eyes. You cannot walk in someone else’s shoes. Empathy means to acknowledge that someone has different experiences and views from yours. Rather than trying to walk in someone else’s shoes, empathy is about acknowledging that those shoes exists—and that they do not fit your feet.\nFighting the curse of knowledge through empathy is a great start. While it is valuable to acknowledge that the less knowledgeable state of mind is different from ours, we are limited by not being very good at figuring out what exactly the less knowledgeable state of mind looks like—in the audience and in ourselves.\nAs communicators we also need to have empathy for ourselves, as we were in the less knowledgeable state before we became experts at the topic we are communicating. Unfortunately, we are also not good in empathizing with our past selves in less knowledgeable states. This inability stems from being anchored in a state of mind full of hindsight created by the receipt of knowledge (Fischhoff 1975).\nIn preparing material, ask for feedback. What resonated with the audience? What did they not understand? Reread your own material after some time. If it is not clear what you meant by something or why you wrote a passage the way you did, how can you assume that the audience will understand what you meant?\nSoftware engineers experience this phenomenon the hard way when they do not document code when they write it. At the time, it is perfectly clear to them how the code works and why it is written the way it is. Six months removed from it they wonder what in the world this code is supposed to do, how it works, and who wrote it.\nThe next piece of advice to defeat the curse of knowledge is to use concrete and relatable language to describe complex things. Avoid abstract language and jargon. Use analogies (something is like something else, “life is like a box of chocolates”) and metaphors (compare two things directly, “time is money”) to communicate complex topics. Metaphors and analogies make the unfamiliar seem familiar, they ease the audience into a topic, break down barriers, and provide a comforting baseline understanding.\nRather than trying to figure out what you meant by random error, referring to noise in the system allows the audience to connect a statistical concept to real-life concept and to follow along. Unstructured data can turn into doctor’s notes or online buzz. Nonlinear optimization can become finding, a neural network is somewhat brain-like. For more practical advice on using metaphors and analogies, see Chapter 12.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Aristotle’s rhetorical situation\nFigure 1.2: Lasswell’s model of communication\nFigure 1.3: Aristotle’s rhetorical triangle\nFigure 1.5: Emotional connection through someone else’s voice.\nFigure 1.6: Storytelling around camp fire.

    "text": "2.3 The 55/38/7 Formula\nThe 90% figure wasn’t plucked out of thin air. It was Albert Mehrabian, a researcher of body language, who first broke down the components of a face-to-face conversation. He found that communication is 55% nonverbal, 38% vocal, and 7% words only. This is where the idea that the vast majority of communication is nonverbal originated, but does this really mean that less than 10% of information is conveyed in spoken words?\nIt turns out that the above formula was developed with a specific purpose in mind: comparing facial and vocal components to decipher a person’s attitude. According to Mehrabian,\n\nWhen there are inconsistencies between attitudes communicated verbally and posturally, the postural component should dominate in determining the total attitude that is inferred.\n\nThe communication happened in a situation where verbal and non-verbal channels were inconsistent. In that case, non-verbal communication is more important. If someone writhes in agony on the ground with an open fracture, a bone sticking out, and yells “I am OK!”, we believe the non-verbal cues of a person in pain and not the spoken words. They are not OK.\nIn normal situations, where the verbal and non-verbal channels are aligned, non-verbal communication is not the most important channel. Otherwise we would not be able to comprehend the Gettysburg address by reading. But non-verbal communication is a very important channel. In a face-to-face conversation, body language and facial expressions have a remarkable impact on how information is interpreted and retained.\nIn “The Definitive Book of Body Language,” Allan and Barbara Pease analyzed thousands of recorded sales negotiations from the 1970s and 1980s and found that body language accounted for the majority of the impact made negotiating. They also considered how the person with the strongest argument usually wins in negotiations over the phone but not always in face-to-face conversations. Although the idea that 90% of communication is nonverbal can be put to rest, a person’s body language and our first impression of them can heavily influence our decision-making.",

    "text": "2.5 Making a Good First Impression\nIf you’re interested in a communications career, you’ll come to learn the true value of a first impression. Allan and Barbara Pease also assert that when we meet people for the first time, we make snap judgments about their friendliness, assertiveness, and appearance. Without a single word being spoken, without even realizing it, people use nonverbal communication to size people up.\nAccording to the 55/38/7 formula, nearly 40% of a person’s attitude is conveyed vocally through tone and inflection, so try to ensure that your tone matches whatever message you’re trying to convey. You can also try speaking in a deeper voice. Research has shown that people who speak with a low-pitched voice are rated more authoritative and competent than those who speak with a higher pitch.\nAlthough people are rarely conscious of their body language and facial expressions, there are a couple of behaviors a person can tweak to improve their communication skills. For instance, research has shown that it takes conscious effort for a person to frown when looking at someone smiling—a smile is literally infectious. Research also shows that both men and women are more attracted to people who make eye contact and smile more often. A smile and just the right amount of eye contact can help you effectively convey information during first impressions and long after.\nHand gestures can not only express your thoughts but also convey your enthusiasm and passion for a topic. According to body language expert Dr. Carol Kinsey Goman, “Gesturing can help people form clearer thoughts, speak in tighter sentences and use more declarative language.” As with tone, try to ensure that your hand gestures match what you’re saying, otherwise people will notice the mismatch and may be less likely to trust you.\nInterpreting Body Language Body language can also provide insight into a person’s emotional condition. For example, you likely already know that someone who crosses their arms is guarded or discontent even when they claim the contrary. Reading body language is like learning a second language and can help separate perception from reality.\nAccording to Dr. Jeff Thompson, we can better decipher nonverbal signals by remembering the three C’s of nonverbal communication: context, clusters, and congruence. We’ve already covered congruence—comparing spoken words to body language and tone. Applying context means better understanding the setting. For example, knowing that someone has anxiety can explain why they appear tense during a fireworks display. Finally, using clusters means using not one but multiple expressions or movements to influence our interpretation of a person’s body language.\nThere’s So Much More to Communication How much of communication is nonverbal? It may not be exactly 90%, but nonverbal communication—eye contact, smiling, hand gestures—heavily influences how people interpret and react to information. This is an important lesson to learn for anyone interested in a communications career, and it’s only the tip of the iceberg. ## Interpersonal",

When the judges respond to a contestant’s performance they are often praised as storytellers.\nTelling stories is widely accepted as the most effective, persuasive, and influential form of communication. Stories help us learn and remember by connecting us emotionally to the narrative.\nWhat is a story, what is storytelling, and why is it effective?\nA story is a narrative with a beginning, a middle, and an end. This is also described with the ABT formula in Oliver (2023):\nIn addition to the ABT story arc, a story has\nMany data scientists believe in the old adage that\nand, as a result, assume that presentations high on visual content will automatically resonate with the audience. Not so. While visual aids are often more effective than text, tables, and bullet points, by themselves they are not sufficient to create memorable content. And, it often does not take 1,000 words to communicate something. Fewer words, carefully chosen, can create memorable content because they tell great stories.\nIn fact, you might not need many words at all to tell a great story. Check out this visual essay about gun deaths in the U.S. in 2018. It has many of the ingredients of a great story. Can you identify beginning, middle, end, characters, place, time, plot, and conflict?\nThe elements of a story listed above are the ingredients for your recipe. Just like visualizations by themselves are not stories, using the ingredients does not guarantee a well-told story. Having ingredients does not imply a well-cooked meal.

    "text": "3.2 Why are Stories Effective\nWe have seen in Chapter 1 that Aristotle said effective oratory has three appeals, logos (the logical arguments, the facts), ethos (the credibility), and pathos (eliciting an emotional response). The human brain processes information through emotions, information is meaningful when it evokes emotion. Storytelling connects us emotionally to the narrative; that is why it is so effective.\nAs social animals we tend to adopt the positions of those to whom we have a strong social connection. Endorsing the position reinforces the connection to others with whom we share important commitments.\nIn his brilliant TEDx talk about the magical science of storytelling, David JD Phillips asks\n\nHow is it possible for you to be so easily tricked by something so simple as a story?\n\nWatch for yourself:\n\nTo summarize the content of the TEDx talk:\nWe started developing language about 100,000 years ago, long before we invented cave paintings (~27,000 years ago), text (~3,500 years ago), or PowerPoint (1987). Our brains are wired to transferring knowledge through storytelling more than any other format.\nDavid Phillips describes the “angels’ cocktail” of three hormones that are induced into our brains through (effective) storytelling:\n\nDopamine. Dopamine is also called the “feel-good hormone”, it is involved in motivation and deciding whether to engage. Higher levels of dopamine increase focus, attention, creativity, and memory. You increase dopamine in your audience by creating suspense in your story, making the audience wait and expect. When we are waiting and anticipating, we are paying attention.\nOxytocin. Oxytocin is also called the “love hormone”, it is produced when we form relationships and during sexual activity. The effects of greater oxytocin level is to bond, trust, and to become more generous. It makes us feel more human and more relaxed. In storytelling you increase oxytocin in the audience by creating empathy in the characters. E\nEndorphins. Endorphins have the effect of relieving pain, reducing stress and anxiety, and make us feel good. An effective way to create endorphins is to make people laugh. They become more focused, relaxed, and creative.\n\nBrain researchers describe a mind meld between teller and listener during storytelling. It is not as if the two brains act as one, but more like the brain activity patterns seen in the storyteller are mirrored in the listener, whether there is one listener or many. And the more similar the brain patterns are, the better the transfer of memories.\nIn telling the stories in the TEDx talk, Phillips combines the tools and ingredients of storytelling with the art of storytelling to connect with the audience.",

Here we use data to craft a compelling narrative. When journalists do this it is called data journalism. You also encounter the term visual essays.\nStorytelling about Data. Here we use storytelling principles to create a compelling story about the results of data science.\n\n\nVisual Essays\nHere are some great examples of data journalism and visual essays, using data to tell a powerful story.\nThe next three examples are curated by the company Shorthand which develops tools for data storytelling.

A Sky News story of the immediate impact of Brexit on the UK.\nThe annual impact report of Oxfam Ireland, a world-wide development organization fighting against inequality, poverty, and injustice.\nThe Arab News story about Jews of Lebanon, using simple graphics to tell the story of a minority community.\n\nAs you scroll through these publications, ask yourself\n\nWhat do these presentations have in common?\nWhy is a particular presentation effective or ineffective?\nWhich graphical elements are being used?\nCan you identify components of the dramatic arc and storytelling principles?\n\nFor twenty great examples of visual essays and visual storytelling, check out this collection.\nA particularly powerful–in my opinion–data story is being told with a single graph style in this story about gun deaths in the U.S. It was introduced earlier in the chapter. If you revisit the visual essay now, can you also identify the emotional appeals of the story and how it helps you connect to the material?\n\n\nTelling Stories about Data (Science)\n\n\nComnbine visuals and language\nRecall that our brains are most wired to knowledge transfer through language, followed second by knowledge transfer through images. Combining visualization with language allows you to craft compelling stories that unlock the meaning of what you wish to convey.\nBeautiful graphics are an element of a data story, but cannot by themselves provide the context in which the meaning is unlocked. They are part of the story. The production value of graphics and slides does not translate to a good story in itself.\nYou are using language and visualizations to make connections. What you say and what you show are not the story in itself. The audience will not remember the particular graphic. The audience will not remember the layout of the slides. But they will remember the characters in your story.\n\n\nFocus on the audience\nThis is trivial but it bears repeating. You are presenting material for the benefit of the audience, not for the benefit of the data science team. Go back and read that sentence again.\nEverything you do should be focused on how to connect with the audience and make them memorize the meaning of your content. So you do not talk about the data science team and its accomplishments. It is not about you, it is about them! You talk about what the material you present means for them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits\n\n\n\nIt is OK to acknowledge the team at the end of the presentation, possibly in appendix material that is shared with the presentation but not displayed in the room.\nPay attention to how many presentations start with “This is Me”, “This is Who we Are”, “This is What we Do”, “These are our collaborators”. You do not ever want to take credit for things you or the team did not do and you do not ever want to take credit away from others. The beginning of the presentation is not where you do that, however.\nThe counter argument that is sometimes made is that the audience has a limited attention span and putting credits and acknowledgements at the end buries them. By the time you get there the audience is exhausted and that misrepresents the team’s hard work and accomplishments. Also, if you run long you might not get to that part of the presentation.\nTwo responses to this counter argument:\n\nThe value of the work and the accomplishments of the team need to be evident from the content you are presenting.\nIf you are not getting through the material you need to work on the presentation. Not getting to material is the wrong kind of cliffhanger for the audience.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate engagement\nThe modern office or classroom environment is not at all like sitting around a campfire at night. There are glass walls, people moving around, a clock in the corner of the room, HVAC systems going on and off, distractions from devices. On the plus side, you are not worried about being distracted by a saber-toothed tiger.\nStarting a presentation by talking about process and methods, and introducing the team is a good way to lose the audience early on. You will have to fight against the current to re-engage them. Remember the ABT formula:\n\nAnd this is the way things were\nBut there was a problem\nTherefore this is how it resolved\n\nGet right into it.\nTo draw the audience in, use relatable experiences and frame them in the language of “you” and “yours”. Stimulate curiosity by raising an open question or mentioning a surprise result. Instead of opening with a slide titled “Fourth Quarter Cloud Expense Forecast” consider opening with these statements:\n\nA look at our recent data suggested costs would increase. But did they?\n\n\nDo cloud expenses really affect the bottom line?\n\n\nDo the data support the conventional wisdom of subscription model vs pay as you go?\n\n\nWhen I saw the data I was reminded that I never again want to wait in line\n\nWhen sharing your own experiences, you are drawing on yourself as an example. Avoid oversharing and just talking about yourself.\nThe audience will be drawn to you if you are passionate and having fun working on this problem. It engages their curiosity, wondering what it is about this topic that makes you so passionate. The interest in the topic rubs up on the audience. Avoid any extremes. If you are too serious or dispassionate the audience might perceive that there might be deep-rooted issues with the material. If you are goofy or joke too much you will be seen as not serious and lacking credibility.\n\n\nStory helpers\nHow do you go from having the statement\n\nWe are predicting a 7% increase in revenue in the next quarter\n\nto having a story?\n\nAnecdotes\nAnecdotes are short, relevant, personal accounts of something relevant. The anecdote should be short enough not to distract from the story and long enough to be interesting. If you are telling a story about customers failing to sign up for the paid subscription service after a trial period, you could tell an anecdote about how you recently decided to use an online service because you could create the account through an existing service rather than creating a new username/password combination that you are loathe to track.\n\n\nCase studies\nA case study explains how a problem led to a solution. The case study does not have to present the identical problem as the one you are telling a story about. It just has to be a relatable study that suggests a possible solution path. Case studies are useful if the audience has experience with problems like those addressed in the case study.\n\n\nExamples\nExamples are similar to case studies, except they do not necessarily lay out the challenge or the solution. They can relate the audience to what other organizations are doing. Examples help convey that you are not solving an isolated or unusual problem and others are thinking about it as well.\n\n\nScenarios\nA scenario is when you lay out a series of events and you ask the audience to predict each outcome. Scenarios are hypothetical and help get ideas out into the open. Make sure that the scenario is not too simple, otherwise it sounds like a children’s story. Like anecdotes, scenarios work best at the beginning of the story and should be told in the third person—you are not relating a personal experience:\n\nImagine a customer wants to move from the trial experience to a paid subscription. They like the ease with which they can flip the account but are hesitant because they have heard that it is a hassle to discontinue the service in the future.\n\nAnecdotes, case studies, examples, and scenarios are not stories in themselves. They help you weave your story and give the larger message more meaning.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Storytelling frameworks according to Eric Partaker.

A director in the Finance department shoots you this email in the morning:\nIf this question hits the desk of the data science team, does everyone know what needs to be done? Is it clear what the question is? Is there a deeper question here that needs to be answered first?\nFraming of a problem expresses the issue on behalf of those who are experiencing it, in a way that the team can develop a shared understanding (Church 2023). Without proper framing, the team cannot rally around the problem and develop a solution. Well-framed problems are expressed in a meaningful way and set the team up for success. Ill-framed problems have the opposite effect.\nThe question about the growth of the SaaS is not well framed. A better ask would have been:\nTwo methodological approaches that help unpack a problem and get to its essence are The 5-Why framework and the 40-20-10-5 rule. This is known as root cause analysis.",

    "text": "Has the SaaS business been growing over the past three months and will the trend continue over the next quarter?\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasured by net retention rate (NRR), what is the NRR over the past quarter and can you predict the NRR for the next quarter, assuming that we make no major changes to sales and marketing?\n\n\n\nThe 5 Whys\nThis framework was developed in the 1950s at Toyota to improve production quality and is still in use today. It works best for small and simple problems but you can try it on any problem. If it turns out that the causes for each Why create their own lines of inquiry, the 5-Why tool is too simple.\nThe idea is to state the problem and then ask repeatedly “Why did this happen?”, up to five times. At any point, the Why might reveal the root cause of the problem. If it does not, drill deeper and go to the next question (Figure 4.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: The 5-Why framework for root cause analysis.\n\n\n\nThe first Why should reveal the main problem, but is not necessarily the root cause of the problem. Any of the Why can reveal the root cause and you do not necessarily have to go down 5-deep.\n\n\nProblem: The Website was not Updated in Time.\n\n\n\nWhy did this happen?\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) The developers did not have the content they needed.\nWhy did this happen?\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) The copywriter did not provide the content.\nWhy did this happen?\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) The copywriter was waiting on approval from the VP Marketing.\nWhy did this happen?\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) The VP Marketing forgot to approve the content.\nWhy did this happen?\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) He was on a business trip.\n\nPossible solutions:\n\nMake sure that approval authority is delegated prior to absences from office.\nEnsure that time for content approval is allocated during absences.\nSet up an automated approval process that moves a decision to next in line if the decision is not made within a certain time frame.\nBump the decision to the Senior VP Marketing if the VP does not respond within a certain time. Bump the decision then to the Executive VP Marketing if the SVP does not respond within a certain time.\nReplace the VP of Marketing with someone who has better memory.\n\n\n\nThe framework is not useful if the responses are informed by personal biases and do not get to the heart of the issues. Preconceived notions about the causes can mislead the analysis as can reliance on guesses or assumptions. Being convinced that one has found the root cause can lead to superficial solutions.\n\n\nProblem: The Application Crashed while Scoring a Model Online\n\n\n\nWhy did this happen?\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) The code tried to access invalid memory when reading one of the variables needed in the scoring model.\nWhy did this happen?\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) No memory was allocated for the variable, instead, the application tried to read from a NULL pointer causing a segmentation violation.\nWhy did this happen?\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) No information was available for the particular variable, hence no memory was allocated.\nWhy did this happen?\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) The input form does not require a valid input, the user can leave it blank.\n\nIf you stop after the first Why the solution is to make sure memory is always valid, implying to allocate memory for all variables and to pre-populate it with default values, for example, NULLs or NaNs.\nYou would still have to make sure that the application can process NULL and NaN values. The same is true if you stop after the second Why.\nDigging deeper we get to the reason for the absence of data. It seems that if the information is required, then the data intake form should make sure that a valid value is populated based on user input. The downstream checks for NULL/NaNs and sufficient memory allocation are good programming practice anyway but are not solving the root cause of the crash—they are resolving the symptoms of the crash.\n\n\nThe 5-Why procedure starts with formulating a short and specific problem or issue the team needs to address. It helps to have a facilitator, who is not a team member, to ask “Why did this happen?”. The team shoul make effort to confirm their responses with data where possible. You stop asking “Why did this happen?” when one of the following occurs:\n\nThere is no new information.\nYou get to the “Aha!” moment when the team realizes the root cause. For example, you get to “Oh no, I cannot believe we have been doing it that way all this time!”\nThe reasons are outside the team’s control.\nThe responses start to repeat.\n\n\n\nThe 40-20-10-5 Rule\nThis rule is related to the 5-why framework in that it is trying to get to the essence of a problem. The approach is different.\nRather than repeatedly asking why something happened, the 40-20-10-5 rule asks us to reframe the problem using fewer and fewer words. It is not that important whether you start with 40 or 80 words, what matters is to increasingly strip away stuff that does not matter. What you are left with is the essence of the problem. The root of the problem emerges as the number of words is reduced.\n\n\nProblem: The Application Crashed while Scoring a Model Online\n\n\n40-words: A segmentation violation occurred when the code scored a data record collected online that contained invalid data. Specifically, a NULL pointer was accessed instead of a memory address where memory was allocated to hold the user-supplied value for the variable.\n20-words: When the application encounters a NULL pointer it crashes, this can be the result of not retrieving data and not setting defaults.\n10-words: Missing user input results in memory not being allocated.\n5-words: User did not provide data.",

    "text": "4.2 SUCCESs—Ideas That Stick\nIn their book Made To Stick, the brothers Chip and Dan Heath ask why some ideas stick and others die (Heath and Heath 2007). At the beginning of the book they contrast a passage from a document and a story.\n\n\nPassage: Community Building\n\n\nComprehensive community building naturally lends itself to a return-on-investment rationale that can be modeled, drawing on existing practice. A factor constraining the flow of resources to CCIs is that funders must often resort to targeting or categorical requirements in grant making to ensure accountability.\n\n\n\n\n\nStory: Kidney Heist (abbreviated)\n\n\nDave is a frequent business traveler. On a recent trip to Atlantic City he had time to kill after meeting with clients and before his flight home. He went to a local bar for a drink. He’d just finished one drink when an attractive woman approached and asked if she could buy him another. Sure, he said. The woman brought two drinks back from the bar, one for her and one for him. Dave took a sip and that was the last thing he remembered.\nHe woke up, disoriented, in a hotel bathtub filled with ice. He spotted a note along with a cell phone on a small table beside the bathtub: “DON’T MOVE. CALL 911”.\nHis fingers numb from the ice, he called 911. The operator seemed oddly familiar with his situation. She said “Sir, I want you to reach behind you, slowly and carefully. Is there a tube protruding from your lower back?”\nSure enough, there was a tube. The operator said “Sir, don’t panic, but there is a ring of organ thieves operating in this city; they harvested one of your kidneys. Paramedics are on their way.”\n\n\nSuppose you had just read those texts for the first time and are asked to retell them tomorrow. Which passage or story would you be more likely to recount? Almost all of us would remember the kidney heist story, including many of its details: the bar, the drinks, the woman, the bathtub filled with ice water, the 911 operator. And of course, getting your kidney harvested. I say “almost all of us” because some might find the passage on community building more memorable—if that is you, then you are a rarity.\nHeath and Heath (2007) develop a framework for gauging the stickiness of an idea. A sticky idea is one that is understood and remembered, and has a lasting impact by changing the audience’s opinions or behavior. The concept of the sticky idea translates directly to sticky communication.\nIn order for an idea to be sticky it does not have to be truthful. The kidney heist story is an urban legend. And it is a very sticky story. The story first appeared in 1991 and circulated widely for more than a decade, despite being debunked. For a fact check of the story and a hint of its possible origin, click here.\nBut wait, why do we need a framework for making our communications “stick”? We already know about storytelling principles, we know the goal of the communication, and we know the audience. Think of a biology school teacher who knows their audience, knows the material (cell mitosis), and is a very effective speaker. All the ingredients for a successful lecture on mitosis are there. The big question is about the message. How should the teacher communicate mitosis to the students?\nThe framework of the Heath brothers is about how to craft the core message and it rests on six principles:\n\nSimplicity. The message must be simple, not in the sense of being dumbed down, but in the sense of being stripped down to its core, its essence.\nUnexpectedness. To maintain audience interest when it takes time to get an idea across, we can stoke their curiosity by opening and closing gaps in their knowledge.\nConcreteness. Convey the message in terms of human actions and sensory information with concrete images: the bathtub filled with ice. By communicating concrete messages, everyone will understand the message the same way.\nCredibility. Sticky ideas carry their own credentials. The audience can see for themselves that the message is credible.\nEmotions. To make people care about your idea, make them feel something. Tap into what the audience cares about. This might require work finding out what exactly your audience does care about. Heath and Heath (2007) give the example of teenagers these days not quitting smoking because of health consequences but because they resent the duplicity of tobacco companies.\nStories. Hearing stories prepares us to act on ideas. Stories make the message memorable.\n\nIn short, sticky ideas are Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credentialed, Emotional Stories (SUCCESs).",

    "text": "5.1 Glossophobia\nGlossophobia is the is the fear of public speaking. It is a form of social anxiety that goes beyond being nervous; it is an intense fear that can be paralyzing and can be associated with physical symptoms such as sweating, dry mouth, rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure, nausea, shaking, dilated pupils, a tense or shaky voice, shortness of breath, excessive vocal fillers, a lump in your throat, and going blank. In extreme cases you might throw up or pass out—that makes for a memorable speech.\nFear of public speaking is extremely common. Estimates are as high as 75% of the population being affected by glossophobia in some way. It is a social anxiety because we believe that interactions with others will result in negative evaluations, judgment, and rejection. This creates negative thoughts of failure and the belief of being incapable of speaking well in front of others.\nWhat causes glossophobia is not well understood. Traumatic past events play a role. Being ridiculed or embarrassed in a situation of public speaking can turn a confident speaker into someone afraid of and avoiding public speaking.\nBeing full of dread and going through physical responses does not improve ones quality of speech. Afraid of public speaking you avoid public speaking at all cost. Glossophobia is a self-fulfilling feedback loop.\nBecause of the social aspect of glossophobia, the most dreaded speaking situation is in front of peers: the student presenting to the class, the brother of the bride speaking at the wedding, the researcher delivering a talk at the scientific conference, the data scientist explaining the solution to the business stakeholders. The judgment of these peer audiences are particularly important to us and potentially damaging socially or professionally. There is some truth to the Jerry Seinfeld quote.\nThe good news is that help is on the way. Glossophobia can be overcome. Among the remedies are cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness, meditation, muscle relaxation exercises, virtual reality exposure therapy (experiencing the anxiety inducing situation through virtual reality), and medication (beta-blockers and such). CBT attempts to replace negative self-talk with positive self-talk and is a popular option. You might also have heard of recommendations such as “imagine the audience members are in their underwear” or smelling lavender.\nI am not going to comment on these treatment approaches and advice such as smelling herbs or imaginary audiences. The best approach to deal with fear of public speaking—in my opinion—is to practice public speaking and to get better at it. It is a skill that can be learned and practiced.",

    "text": "7.1 Principles of Effective Writing\nIn his classic book Style: The Art of Writing Well, F.L. Lucas lays out a number of principles of effective writing (Lucas 2012).\nThe first foundation of style is character or personality. The personality of the writer shines through in the words and the goal is to inform and move the reader.\nThis agrees with Aristotle’s ethos appeal in the context of oratory: credibility of the message and credibility of the speaker (writer).\nThe next foundational pieces of good writing are brevity and clarity. Lucas writes\nThe social purpose of language is communication – to inform, misinform, or otherwise influence. Obscurity (the lack of clarity) is an unnecessary evil caused by incoherence, overcrowding of ideas, lack of examples, overuse of jargon, sentences built into mazes and labyrinths, overloaded paragraphs, long sentences, etc.\nIn technical writing, clarity takes precedence over all other rules. Sentences should be beautifully clear.\nThe end of the paragraph is a place where the reader can rest and collect their thoughts. A considerate writer makes those rest places not too rare. If in doubt, it is safer to make paragraphs too shirt rather than too long.\nHow is clarity to be acquired? Mainly by writing to serve people rather than to impress them. Most lack of clarity comes from the ambition to be admired for a depth of sense or wealth of ornament. Use short words, short sentences, and paragraphs. Do not try to cram too many things at once. Show empathy for the audience and imagine their state of mind—fight the curse of knowledge.",

    "text": "8.1 Introduction\nWe introduced nonverbal communication as a form of communication in Section 1.2.2 as the ways in which we convey information by other means than speaking or writing. The 7% myth, namely that 93% of communication is nonverbal, was debunked there. Whatever the true percentage, nonverbal communication is very important. You can use it to your advantage and you can sabotage communication efforts with it. The 93% importance of nonverbal communication came from situations where the nonverbal cues contradicted the verbal message.\nNonverbal communication has multiple functions and effects. In his teaching notes from Andrews University, Dean Emeritus Dr. Charles Tidwell lists\nMuch of it is kind of obvious, for example, the effects of posture, body language, gestures, eye contact, distance you keep, tone of voice, and so on. It still takes awareness and practice to avoid nonverbal mistakes and to draw on positive nonverbal cues to strengthen your communication. Finally, pointing out elements of nonverbal communication, you become more aware and tuned in, making it easier to read situations.\nIt is easy to list what to do and what not to do with respect to nonverbal communication, but changing things can be difficult or impossible. A behavior can be due to an obsessive compulsive disorder. Maybe fidgeting or playing with their hair is exactly what helps someone focus. It is easy to say “make eye contact”, it is much more difficult for an introvert than an extrovert. In trying to fix a nonverbal cue you might overdo it and create the opposite effect; keeping excessive eye contact is creepy and considered aggressive.\nA Business Insider article from 2016 listed “9 horrible body language habits that are hard to quit”, such as\nFor starters, these should not be referred to as “horrible”. We all do some of these to varying degrees. I slouch and I slouch more when I am tired. There is nothing wrong with shuffling while talking at times, it can be used to make a point about a slow-moving process. It can be a problem if that is the only way a speaker moves. The article was met with contemptuous comments such as\nThe important thing is recognizing what can be improved, and working on that. With so many poor communicators around, even small improvements can make you stand out. Be yourself, but be the best version of yourself,\nWhether a behavior can be changed or not, it is helpful to understand how cues are typically interpreted and what signals they send.",

    "text": "To repeat the verbal message—pointing in a direction while stating directions\nTo accent the verbal message—tone indicates the meaning\nTo complement the verbal message—a nod reinforces a positive message, a wink can contradict the verbal message\nTo regulate interactions—conveying with hand gestures that a person should speak\nTo substitute for the verbal message—raising fingers to lips to indicate quiet\n\n\n\n\nExample: The First Meeting\n\n\nA client is meeting a statistical consultant in her office for the first time. As the client enters, he notices a stack of papers on the chair in front of a massive desk, the statistician sits behind the desk, looking at her computer. Without looking up from the computer she waves the client in, points at the chair, and says “Hello, come on in. Take a seat.”\nThe nonverbal cues and the setting convey that the consultant is not very interested in the appointment or the consulting job. The fact that the chair intended for the client is used to store papers signals “don’t get comfortable, don’t stay very long”. Seating herself behind a large desk creates a barrier and puts the client in an inferior position. Not making eye contact is another nonverbal cue that this meeting is not very important.\nCompare this to the setting where she has a small round conference table in her office, shows the client in, gets up from behind her desk, walks toward the door, looks at the client, points at the conference table, and greets them with “Hello, come on in. Take a seat.” She waits for the client to be seated before taking her seat.\nThe same greeting is used in both cases. And even if spoken with the same enthusiasm, the nonverbal cues convey very different messages. In the second setting the cues and the vocalization are completely aligned, creating a welcoming and respectful environment. In the second setting they are misaligned and the message conveyed by the verbal cues wins: I am busy and not very interested, do not have much time for you, don’t stay too long; you and your project do not matter much to me.\n\n\n\n\n\nfidgeting\nplaying with your hair\nadopting a defensive pose\nshuffling instead of walking\nforgetting to smile\nslouching\nnonexisting or aggressive eye contact\n\n\n\nwait you mean..stop being autistic? DIDNT KNOW I COULD DO THAT OH MY GOD!!!!!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Experience\n\n\n\nA good method to improve nonverbal cues by reinforcing positive and avoiding negative nonverbal communication is to record oneself and watching it critically. It is also a very painful method. Our voice sounds different in our own head, which is why recordings of ourselves sound strange. “Do I really sound like that?”\nSeeing a video of yourself speaking is awkward and cringey. “Is that what I sound and look like?”. Well, yes, that is what we sound and look like.\nBefore giving a speech, I would practice at home or in my office several times without recording. Then I rehearse once or twice on a stage, recording video and audio in front of people that would give me honest and constructive feedback.\nThe same issues would come up: too much pacing, hands folded in front of the body (the “praying” posture), speaking too fast. I am still working on those issues. But once aware, I can catch myself pacing or praying during a talk, stand still, face the audience and show open palms.",

Filler words can be used to provide space and thinking time for the speaker and the audience, they can indicate that the speaker is not yet finished, and make conversation seem less abrupt. A good-natured hesitation before delivering bad news can indicate emotion.\nWhen used excessively, filler words make the speaker sound unprepared and unsure, and they wear on the audience. They distract from the other words in your message. The audience has to filter them out of the message to get to the meaning.\nAnd then there are particularly grating filler phrases, made up of collections of filler words: “and so on and so forth”, “at the end of the day”, “to be honest”, “to tell you the truth”, “you know what”, “you know what I’m saying”, and so on and so forth.\nFiller words often come out unconsciously, which makes them difficult to, you know, basically stop. When writing, re-read sentences looking for words that can be deleted without altering the meaning. Compare the following pairs of sentences:\n\nI just hit a deer.\nI hit a deer.\n\n\nCan you just send me the file?\nCan you send me the file?\n\nIn the first case just anchors the event in time, the deer was hit recently. It is not a filler word. In the second case just can be removed without altering the meaning, you are asking for the file to be sent. It is a filler word in that case.\nWhen speaking, here are some hints to avoid or reduce the use of filler words:\n\nSlow down. Using filler words might be caused by speaking too fast. You then insert filler words to give yourself time to catch up to the spoken words. Slowing down speech gives you more time to think and makes the conversation more relaxed.\nEmbrace the silence. We use filler words to avoid silence and pauses in speech. Silence does not have to be awkward, it can lend emphasis and draw the audience in. If you are not sure what to say next, do not say anything at all. Keep calm and soldier on.\nNegative Practice. Overdo the very thing you want to avoid doing. For example, if you tend to use “like” as a filler word, make a conscious effort to use “like” 10 times in each sentence. By practicing what you want to avoid, you are moving the habit from the subconscious mind to the conscious mind. And now you can address it by replacing the word “like” with a short pause.\nRecord yourself. Play back the recording and count filler words. We all use them more than we think we are.",

    "text": "9.1 Introduction\nIn his book about the craft of scientific presentations, Alley (2013) tells the story of Zhengzhi Sheng, a postdoc at the University of Arkansas. Sheng had discovered a new superconductor, a very big deal that called for a press conference. Because Sheng was not a good speaker, the department chair Allen Hermann spoke at the press conference. Despite Hermann acknowledging the contribution of Sheng, it was Hermann who would receive most of the accolades for the discovery.\nIf we cannot effectively present our work as data scientists, we\nPresenting brings together the major forms of communication: speaking words combines with using written words and visual aids to support the story. A possibly great presentation can be derailed by shortcomings in any of these. The greatest content does not resonate if it is delivered in a flat tone of voice, boring, with lots of filler words (“Um”, “So”, “OK”, “Aaaand”, “Right”, “You know”). Slides with too many words distract the audience by reading. Poorly chosen visualizations leave them puzzled.\nDrawing on Aristotle’s rhetorical triangle (Section 1.1), content (logos) is king and must not be sacrificed by burying it in extraneous details. But great content delivered without passion (pathos) misses the impact it could have. If it is obvious that we do not care about the subject, how can we expect the audience to care? In presentations of technical content scientists and engineers tend to place much emphasis on logos, the facts and logical evidence supporting the assertions. This can work well for an audience of scientists and engineers but not for a non-technical audience where character (ethos) and emotional appeal (pathos) are very important.\nPresentations have advantages and disadvantages, why give a presentation if you could communicate by email, write a document, or produce an online visual essay? In many organizations presentations are common to share and disseminate information. You might not get a chance to choose the communication medium and be asked to give an oral presentation.\nFace-to-face presentations have advantages over other forms of communication that you should be aware of and take advantage of:\nFace-to-face presentations have also distinct disadvantages (Alley 2013). The information delivery is restricted to the pace of the speaker. For some audience members this pace is too slow, for others it is too fast. Unless the presentation is recorded, there is a single opportunity for the presenter to deliver and for the audience to attend. The audience cannot verify background information at the time information is communicated or look up unfamiliar words. Maybe most important, the success of the presentation correlates with the presenter’s ability to deliver the content.",

    "text": "9.2 Speaking Style\nWhat are the greatest fears regarding oral presentations? To stand in front of the audience and to forget the words. To look stupid. To get stuck. To say something incorrect. To not be able to answer questions. To rely on technology that fails when it counts. To disappoint.\nNot knowing what to say or forgetting the words ranks high among the dread of public speaking. This can be overcome with preparation, but before you prepare you have to settle how to deliver the words.\nAlso, never forget that the only person who knows the presentation is you. If you skip some material this time or add some verbiage next time—only you will know. The fear of forgetting words is somewhat irrational if you consider that the audience does not know what you were going to say.\n\nReading\nUnless you are on a book tour and reading out loud your latest novel to an audience, reading the words is a bad idea. It might give you comfort to look at the text and to see what to say and what comes next. It takes a lot of training to read text and make it not sound like it is being read. Politicians, public speakers, and TV moderators who rely on teleprompters learn to get good at it.\nWithout such practice, read speech comes across as stilted, the pace is unnatural, and it undermines the speaker’s credibility to seemingly have to rely on being given the words.\nFurthermore, reading words concentrates the speaker’s eye on the text and reduces eye contact with the audience. That reduces engagement.\nThe worst option is to put the text on slides and read the slides to the audience. It is amazing how often this presentation style is chosen. One of three things will happen when you read out loud the material on the slides\n\nThe audience focuses on the text, reads along and the voice of the speaker becomes a distraction\nThe audience ignores the text and focuses on the speaker, who is not focused on the audience\nThe audience tries to focus on both text and speaker which makes their head explode because reading and listening have a different pace.\n\nAll three outcomes are bad.\nWhen relying on slide notes that the audience does not see, make sure that the presentation technology allows you to see the nodes in a speaker view. If you rely on those notes for delivery and they are unavailable, the scaffolding for your talk is gone.\nYou might think that having the text of the speech available reduces preparation and rehearsal time. It does not. Being able to present from text as if you are not reading the text takes enormous practice and preparation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you give a recorded presentation to a large audience, you might be speaking into a camera with a teleprompter. The text is projected onto the lens of the camera you are looking at or onto a screen mounted close to the camera lens (Figure 9.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: On camera teleprompter system.\n\n\n\nThis is a particularly difficult setup. You have a limited field of vision, you have to look into the camera, you are also looking at the text you need to deliver, and you have to deliver it as if you are not reading.\nA device that helps make the delivery more natural is to not look directly at the text and to not stare directly at the camera, but to move your eyes around the edges of the camera. This appears to the audience on the other side of the camera as if you are looking around the room. While looking at the bottom frame, then the side frame, then the top frame, and the bottom frame again, you can glance at the words on the teleprompter. Then all you have to do is deliver those words as if you had not read them.\n\n\n\n\nMemorization\nOn the other spectrum from relying on seeing the actual text of the speech is memorization of the speech. This delivery style has advantages and disadvantages too.\nLike reading, the text is precise and identical every time the speech is given. The speaker seems immediately credible for their recall of complex material. They appear to really know their stuff.\nHowever, speaking from memory comes with pitfalls. What if you do not remember the words? The environment in which you memorize and rehearse is likely very different from the environment in which you deliver the presentation. When your body floods with adrenaline at the beginning of the speech, bright lights are shining in your eyes, and all eyes are on you, will you remember every word?\nWhen speaking from memory, the pace can be unnatural and the speech can appear too rehearsed and fake. An audience question can throw you off, there is no opportunity to make adjustments to the speech on the fly.\n\n\nOff the Cuff\nAlso known as impromptu speech, you are delivering without preparation and without additional aids such as notes, cue cards, comfort monitors, or teleprompters.\nImpromptu speech is the polar opposite of reading text. You are freewheeling it. The material is flexible and can be adjusted on the fly, it will be (slightly) different every time. There is typically no outline unless the impromptu speech provides it as part of the oratory. The audience might not be sure where you are going.\nThe potential for disaster is high with this delivery form.\n\n\nExtemporaneous Speech\nExtemporaneous speaking simply means delivering a well-rehearsed speech without memorizing every word based on an outline of the material. It is the speaking style we recommend you should adopt.\nWhen speaking extemporaneously, the pace and delivery is natural and the content is similar but not identical. The audience knows the outline of the talk and understands the broad strokes. You can adjust the pace and wording on the fly if necessary.\nSpeaking extemporaneously takes much practice and preparation. You commit to memory the outline of the talk and generate the words on the spot, even under pressure. Cue cards or notes can help you keep track of the outline and important points you need to make, without providing the exact wording.\nWhen using slides, only a small fraction of the text appears on the slides. The slide content helps both speaker and audience to follow the organization of the talk.\nWhen using note cards, leave them in your pocket or at the podium. Do not carry them around and look at them. This undermines the credibility of the speaker. It is OK to silently look at the notes, but while speaking to the audience the notes should be out of the way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Experience\n\n\n\n\n\nI attended a presentation by noted journalist and biographer Walter Isaacson some years ago. He presented on one of his latest book “Innovators”, a book about the creation of computing and the internet. It was a great speech—I think.\nHe had notes written out in longhand and just before stepping on stage he slipped them into the inside pocket of his jacket. Or so he thought. He had missed the pocket and the pages were now held by only friction between the two sides of the jacket. As he moved around the stage the pages tried more and more to to escape from the jacket. The audience was captivated, following the journey of the note pages, until they finally dropped to the floor. That is all I remember from the speech.\n\n\n\n\nAn end-to-end presentation can involve multiple delivery styles. The overall style can be extemporaneous but you might choose to memorize the first few sentences and the end. You can show and read quotes to make sure they are quoted precisely. When answering questions you use impromptu speech.\n\n\nPreparation and Rehearsal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Experience\n\n\n\n\n\nI was scheduled to give a 11-minute presentation about artificial intelligence from the main stage of a large user conference to about 5,000 attendees. In preparing for the talk I was informed that several comfort monitors would be mounted near the edge of the stage; someone would scroll the text of my speech from the production area (essentially teleprompters).\nThe speech was made more complex because I decided to give it while roaming back and forth across the stage on a hands-free Segway Ninebot. This was symbolic of being assisted by technology—we are driving it, it is not driving us. Clever, eh?\nI prepared for the talk by rehearsing it on the 45-minute loop walking around a lake in the neighborhood. I could fit three to four deliveries into a loop every other day. Rehearsing meant speaking it out loud, folks were probably scratching their head when they saw me talking loudly about artificial intelligence while exercising.\nSeparately, I practiced on the Segway.\nBy the time of the presentation the teleprompting on the comfort monitors was not necessary. It was reassuring to know that the text was there should I need to be reminded. Because of the many rehearsals talking out loud, this was just another one of those occasions giving the speech. I could concentrate on not driving the Segway off the stage.\n\n\n\nWhen you attend an enjoyable 20-minute presentation, you do not see the hard work and preparation that made the presentation enjoyable. Creating and delivering great presentations takes time. Even creating and delivering good or average presentations takes time.\nRegardless of which speaking style you use, you have to prepare for it and the preparation must match the style. For example, giving great unrehearsed, impromptu speeches is very difficult and requires skill and preparation. You have to organize the material on the fly, construct stories as you go, be in total command of the material, and engage the audience without the help of other aids.\nYou might be required to read text when a comfort monitor or teleprompter is used and have to prepare and rehearse to deliver with a natural tone and pace despite reading.\nMost speakers are under-prepared rather than over-prepared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Experience\n\n\n\n\n\nI was fortunate to have an office next to a professor who had won the highest teaching awards at the university. Having taken courses from him myself as a student I remembered the carefully chosen class material, the clever derivations that let us see the light, and the masterful oral delivery.\nWhen I later joined the university as an assistant professor, our offices were next to each other. Before every lecture, even for a course he had taught many times before, he rehearsed the lecture in his office by speaking out loud important parts of the content. That meticulous and dedicated preparation contributed to his teaching excellence.\n\n\n\nPreparation and rehearsal also reduces the chances that Murphy’s Law strikes.\n\nMurphy’s law\nNamed after aerospace engineer Edward A. Murphy, Jr., the law is quoted as\n\nAnything that can go wrong will go wrong.\n\n\nIf something can go wrong, it will.\n\n\nIf there is a possibility of several things going wrong, the one that will cause the most damage will be the one to go wrong.\n\nA corollary of the last law is that if something can go wrong at a worse time it will happen then.\nExamples of Murphy’s law in presentations are many. As you can imagine, these failures are mostly not unforeseeable events you are powerless against. Most of the times they are foreseeable problems that you did not anticipate and did not prepare for.\n\nThe presentation works great on your laptop but you are presenting from someone else’s device that is lacking the necessary fonts.\nA demo crashes because the presentation machine does not have the right software installed.\nA presentation relies on access to the internet, but that is not available when presenting from a client’s conference room.\nThe internet bandwidth does not support the download speed needed to run an animation smoothly.\nNo sound\nThe projector overheats and goes into cooldown mode in the middle of the presentation.\nYou forgot to enable screen sharing on the Mac for the specific video hosting technology.\nThe demo that worked well every time in rehearsal produces really strange results when it matters, because you did not set a random number seed that would make the demo reproducible.\nThe poster presentation looked great on the computer screen but what comes back from the printing center has wonky spacing of paragraphs and graphics. The layout is completely off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Experience\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some examples where Murphy’s law struck presentations I gave or attended and lessons learned.\n\nThis happened. An executive gave a demonstration of social media analytics to the CEO, producing word clouds of the topics most talked about on Twitter (as it was called back then). The technology worked great, the problem was that they queried Twitter live at the time of the demo, and whatever threads they pulled were discussing some X-rated topics. The word cloud produced from that data was memorable.\nLesson. If you use real-time data in a demo, get a copy of the data first, so you know what you are dealing with. Especially when pulling data from the internet, it can be an unfriendly place. Save the data to some place and stream it from there to the application. This is still a live, real-time demo, but it is repeatable. Let the audience know that this is what you are doing.\nThis happened. A candidate for a teaching position gave a test lecture that involved a live Python demo. The machine learning model he was lecturing about was applied to a small data set to facilitate training during class—nothing wrong with that. However the results of the analysis were not meaningful and did not support the points he was trying to make.\nLesson. Random number generators affect statistical results that depend on random numbers in some form. Many data science tasks invole random numbers. The effect of different random number streams is particularly striking with small data sets and small sample sizes, situations that are common in demos that are designed to make a point. Make sure you fix the random number stream by setting a seed in a demo that depends on randomness.\nThis happened. We were rehearsing a large on-stage presentation to several thousand attendees of a software conference. The presentation was also being streamed live to a worldwide audience. The presentation involved four individual live demos by developers of the particular aspect of the software. It was a big deal for the developers to be asked to present their work on such a stage. They had all worked very hard on the presentations, we had rehearsed a number of times at company headquarters. The planning and preparation for such an event takes months. The on-stage rehearsal also went very well, no glitches or hiccups, everybody was on top of their material. We needed internet for the software to work and had brought our own corporate network to the venue so we could hardwire all machines. That is preparation!\n\nThe next day, when it counted, the second or third demo in the lineup did not work at all. It was like the internet was not working for that machine. The developer tried to fix things but was not sure what was going on—while thousands were watching in real time. As moderator of the show I had to improvise and move on, not being able to cover that part of the show. The developer was mortified and embarrassed. To this day I am not sure whether he ever recovered from this experience.\n\nWhat went wrong? During on-stage rehearsal the developer forgot to plug in the Ethernet cable for the corporate network into his laptop. He had run over WiFi and that had worked. After rehearsal, the stage was sequestered and all machines remained on stage for the show in the morning. The machine thus did not get another change to be plugged into the network. While WiFi worked fine during rehearsal with just a few folks in the room, it broke down when thousands of attendees brought their laptops and smart phones into the room.\nLesson. Even after the most meticulous preparation there is something that can get overlooked. If you have multiple things, like multiple laptops in this case, are they all the same? Be prepared to improvise.\nThis happened. A presentation in a hotel ballroom to about 100 attendees. A small production area in the back of the room handled projection on two large screens, microphones, etc. In the middle of the presentation the mic dies and the screens go black. The onstage laptop shows the presentation but everything else is dead.\nWhat went wrong? The cables that ran from the front of the room—where the screens were located—to the production area in the back were supposed to be covered and taped to the floor. You don’t want folks to trip over cables or cables come unplugged. It so happened that just under a desk in the production area the main cable feeding power to the stage was extended by another cable and the two sides had not been taped down. As an engineer moved his feet he knocked the connection loose and the room went dark.\nLesson. Be prepared to improvise.\n\n\n\n\nPreparation helps reduce the chances that presentations derail. In several of the examples, live demos were involved and that adds a certain risk. Many eschew running anything live for fear that things could go wrong. I have always loved demoing things live, running software in real time, analyzing real data during presentations. It makes presentations more interesting, more dynamic, and more real.\nMy advice is not to drop demos and live material and to be prepared for the occasional hiccup when things do not work. For example, have a video of the demo handy (stored locally on your machine) that you produced ahead of time. If the technology does not work for the live demo, show the video.\nAlmost all live elements in presentations worked for me. The few that failed in some way are not reason enough to give up on it.",

    "text": "9.3 Mistakes\nAlley (2013) lists many critical errors in scientific presentations. These also apply to presenting data science content. We summarize some mistakes here unless they have been covered elsewhere in this chapter.\n\nThe Wrong Speech. You might be giving the wrong speech if you are …\n\nNot targeting the audience\nNot grasping the purpose of the presentation\nNot considering the occasion of the presentation\nNot considering the format of the presentation (bringing slides to a roundtable)\n\nBoring the Audience. “Are you not entertained?” To avoid the stinging criticism of a boring presentation, remember storytelling.\n\nMake connections with the audience\nEngage the audience emotionally\nUse metaphors and analogies to relate concepts\nBe passionate\nTell stories\nDo not overwhelm the audience with details\n\nCovering too Much. If you spend 80% of the project doing X, it does not mean you should spend 80% of the project presentation talking about X. Overwhelming the audience with too much content is bad, as is covering content at too great a depth. You should start the presentation at the level of knowledge of your audience. If the goal for the audience is to learn, then you take them from their existing level of knowledge to a higher one. The difficulty is assessing their knowledge accurately.\n\nToo many presentations try to convey all the work that has been done rather than address what the audience wants and needs. If the audience does not want or need to learn, why give a lecture?\n\nImagine the amount of information the audience can consume as the area of a rectangle, the sides represent the scope (or breadth) of the talk and the depth at which the scope is covered. Shorter talks, or talks to audiences with less pre-existing knowledge work with a smaller area. Now you need to decide how to arrange that area into scope x depth (Figure 9.2). Less scope at greater depth or greater scope at lesser depth. A wider scope touches on more topics and allows the audience to connect with something in the talk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: The amount of information covered as a function of scope and depth\n\n\n\nLosing the Audience at the Start. Make the beginning of the presentation as clear and engaging as possible. Moving on from a title slide too fast or an outline slide that would help the audience mentally organize the topic is a recipe for losing the audience at the start. If there are no opportunities to ask questions or to get feedback, you might not get them back.\nLosing the Audience along the Way. It is easy for the audience to fall behind during presentations, even when the presentation is carefully structured. They do not have the luxury to go back and look at something a second time or to take a time out and think about what was just said. By the time they are done contemplating a point the speaker made, the presentation has moved on and increased the gap between speaker and audience./ / An audience that falls behind is getting lost. To minimize the chances of losing the audience you can use a few devices. Mak sure the audience knows the destination of the presentation. Remind them during the presentation where they are now relative to the destination. The old adage “Tell them what you are going to tell them. Tell them. Then tell them what you just told them” applies here. Avoid going off topic or tangential ruminations. Make sure the audience knows when you are speculating, presenting straw-man proposals, and when you are stating facts. Let the audience know when the presentation is transitioning from the beginning to the middle and to the end (remember the ABT formula). Pause at transition points to allow the audience to collect their thoughts and catch up with you.\nPowerPoint (or Google Slides or …). The use of presentation software such as Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides is common and often expected. Unfortunately, it is not a good format to transfer knowledge as we know from the discussion of storytelling (Chapter 3). Jeff Bezos, founder and former CEO of Amazon, famously disallowed the use of PowerPoint at Amazon.\n\nIf you use PowerPoint-style software in presentations, we recommend the assertion–evidence format for slides. A headline-style title provides the assertion of the slide, the important message being conveyed. The remainder of the slide consists of few bullets (if any) and visuals that provide evidence of the assertion.\n\nThe default slide layouts offered by PowerPoint are not necessarily good presentation aids. If you have a title slide, dress it up with an image that connects to the presentation, rather than showing the title of the talk and the speaker affiliation. Short talks do not need an outline talk, if you add an outline, think of a format different from a bullet list. Try to get away from bullet lists as much as you can. How about an assertion or simple sentence centered on the slide as the only element?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Experience\n\n\n\nDuring my time in the corporate world, the visual aids in my presentations changed greatly; from the typical sequence of bullet lists to slides that contain a single image, filling the entire area, with a single term or to slides that contained only a few words to help with organizing a topic. Figure 9.3 and Figure 9.4 are examples of this design philosophy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: A “typical” presentation slide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.4: Presentation slide organizing a topic.\n\n\n\nWhile the slide is shown, I present on the topic displayed as text. The format is visually engaging but keeps the audience focus on the speaker. They are not distracted by text on the slides or what else is going on with the slide, except for taking in the image. Since a slide might stay up for several minutes, the audience has time to connect the elements of the background image with the presentation. A downside of this approach is the need for high-quality images. And you need to know your presentation, the slides are not much help to the speaker to recall the material.\nA nice side effect of adopting this design, no one has ever requested to use my slides in their presentations. Ha! 😄\n\n\n\nNot Paying Attention. There is much that a communicator needs to pay attention to and failure to do so can derail a communication effort. As a presenter, you need to pay attention to the environment, the audience, the technology, and to yourself. A separate chapter is dedicated to Paying Attention (Chapter 11) because there is so much to it.",

    "text": "Discriminative Listening\nWe are born with this listening skill. It allows us to determine intent of what is said without understanding the words. Listening to a conversation in a foreign language exercises our discriminative listening skills. Tone, volume, inflection of voice, along with nonverbal cues such as body language and facial expression help us make sense of what we hear.\nDeveloping discriminative listening skills helps you read the room and read between the lines.\nSuppose I ask a student after lecture whether it was a good one. One student shifts nervously in their chair, looks at the floor, says “Yes” in a soft voice, and then eyes the door. What they are really saying is “Um, not so much. I am trying to get out of here.” Another student makes eye contact, eyebrows raised, smiles, and says with a firm voice “Absolutely.”\n\n\nInformational Listening\nYou engage in this form of listening in the process of learning. The conversation is not so much a two-way exchange, but a teacher delivering information that you want to learn. You are highly engaged to understand the concepts and need to apply critical thinking. Having empathy for the speaker is not as important; you are interested in getting the content, not the emotional context behind the content.\n\n\nPassive Listening\nIf you are a passive listener, you hear the words and maybe recognize the main points, but little gets through to you. You are present in the conversation in body only, nodding along, giving the appearance of being engaged.\nPassive listening is disrespectful and counterproductive. It is also incredibly common. The passive listener cannot wait for the conversation to be over and make their escape.\n\n\nSelective (Biased) Listening\nA selective listener pays attention only to what they want to hear, filtering out everything else. Their attitudes have been settled and they are not open to views that are unaligned with their own. A biased listener is not in tune with what the speaker wishes to communicate. If the other person claims that you are not getting their point, you might be a selective listener.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Experience\n\n\n\nDuring a semi-annual performance review, I was meeting 1:1 with each employee to discuss the last six months, review their self assessment, the 360-degree assessment from their peers, and my assessment as supervisor. Then we would discuss areas of focus for the near future.\nWhen reviewing an employees’ accomplishments there were 20+ things they excelled at. They hit it out of the park. There was one area where they could improve.\nThe one/only thing the employee took away from the conversation was that they needed to improve. They entered the performance conversation anxious and stressed, filtering out any of the positive comments, looking only for negative information.\nIn this case the selective listener paid attention only to what they did not want to hear, the comments perceived as negative.\n\n\n\n\nAttentive Listening\nThe attentive listener pays attention to every word. They are able to repeat back to you everything that was said. But they might not have truly understood it, focusing too much on the literal words to miss the underlying meaning, emotions, and message.\n\n\nActive Listening\nAn active listener is a participant in the conversation. They pay attention to what is being said and engage with the message. An active listener responds when it is their time to speak, asks questions, and offers insight. Whether they agree or disagree with the speaker, they are receptive to their words.\nActive listening creates a positive, productive environment for relationships to grow in. Being present, offering affirmation in body language and our words, mirroring or paraphrasing, and showing curiosity through thoughtful questions is empowering and validating to the listener.\nWe learn a lot more by active listening than listening for one’s turn to speak.\n\n\n“Waiting to Speak” Listening\nThe opposite of active listening is listening for one’s turn to speak. The listener already knows what they are going to say, they are just looking for an opportunity to inject it into the conversation. This listener is focused on their own point and not on the speaker’s perspective.\nThe toxic form of waiting to speak is to interrupt the speaker to make one’s point. With or without interruption, waiting to speak makes the speaker feel unheard, it is disrespectful. Practicing it with interruption ramps up the rudeness score.\nWaiting-to-speak listening is very common. Studies have shown that it takes the human brain about 0.6 seconds to formulate a response to information. Analyzing many conversations it was found that the average gap between people talking was 0.2 seconds. This is only possible if the response is ready before the other person is done talking.\n\n\nEmpathetic Listening\nThe empathetic listener is an active listener; they are paying attention to the emotions behind the words. What is the speaker truly trying to tell me? By bringing empathy to the conversation, the listener recognizes that the speaker has a unique viewpoint and unique experiences that are justified and that inform the meaning of the message.\n\n\nCritical Listening\nCritical listening takes place when you need to analyze complex information and analyze possible solutions to problems. During critical thinking you evaluate what is being said and compare the information to the big picture and everything you know.\n\n\nTips to Improve Active Listening Skills\n\nEye contact\nFace the speaker and make eye contact, but without staring. Too much eye contact can be intimidating and aggressive. Try breaking eye contact every few seconds, looking to the right or left of the speaker. Looking down can seem like you want to end the conversation.\n\n\nPosture\nMake sure your posture is open, not defensive (crossed arms or legs) or aggressive, see Section 8.2. Leaning forward shows you are attentive, leaning into the conversation.\n\n\nNonverbal cues\nLook for (“listen to”) nonverbal signals from the speaker, body language, gestures, tone of voice.\n\n\nDo not interrupt\nInterrupting someone signals that you cannot wait for them to finish what they are trying to say, that their contribution is not important, and what you have to say is more important. Let the other person finish.\nPauses are very effective; you do not have to jump right in after someone finishes, it gives you time to process, and often the speaker will continue. You might be surprised what will be said next—the best part is yet to come.\n\n\nDo not try to solve a problem\nListening is often about just listening. The conversation is not necessarily about you finding a solution for something or someone. The process of articulating what is on our mind often helps us to find a solution ourselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Experience\n\n\n\nI worked closely for many years with a brilliant, albeit quirky, software engineer. We developed a lot of code together. At night or over the weekend I would have an idea and the next day would walk into his office to present it. He would actively listen and in the process of saying things out loud I would realize that what I thought was a brilliant idea was completely nonsense and unworkable.\nIf it had not been for the opportunity to bounce off ideas, I would have stormed into implementing dead end solutions for hours or days.\n\n\nIf you believe you have a solution, ask first if they want to hear it.\n\n\nKeep focus\nIf you are struggling to stay focused on the conversation, try to repeat or paraphrase what you heard. You can first do that in your own head. You can also check in explicitly with the speaker and paraphrase what you just heard. It gives them an opportunity to let you know whether the conversation is on target and it lets them know that they are being heard.\nA good way of paraphrasing is to start a sentence with “What I am hearing is…” or “It sounds like you are saying …” or “Tell me if I have this right, ….”.\nDo not look at your watch. If the conversation has to stay within a time limit, set a timer that allows you to wrap up the conversation. Let the speaker know that you are using a timer because you cannot afford to go over and you also want to make sure that you have a chance to fully listen and respond if necessary.\n\n\nDo not judge\nActively focus on listening what is being said. Do not react emotionally or try to anticipate what will be said next. Reserve judgment and do not jump to conclusions.\n\n\nRemove distractions\nYou can make it a point to remove distractions, such as visibly silencing and putting away your phone at the beginning of the conversation or shutting off a computer screen.\nNothing says “I do not have time for this” and “This is not important” than constantly glancing at a phone or screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Experience\n\n\n\nAn executive I worked with had a habit of placing his phone in plain sight during video calls. Rather than muting the phone he jumped at the opportunity to let the phone interrupt the meeting, take a call or respond to a text message with camera on and audio muted.\nIt was the perfect instrument to tell everyone in the video meeting that they do not matter and that pretty much everything else is more important.\n\n\n\n\nRemove barriers\nActive listening is more difficult if you are separated by a massive desk or conference table. Office desks tend to be imposing barriers, exaggerated by monitors, phones, trophies, family pictures, piles of paperwork, and whatever else adorns them. The person in front of the desk and behind the desk do not come to the conversation as equals—just compare their chairs.\nIf you have the opportunity, move the conversation to a smaller table where speaker and listener sit as equals.\n\n\n\n\nChristian, Brian, and Tom Griffiths. 2017.

    "text": "12.1 What are They?\nIn the literary sense, a metaphor is a figure of speech that equates two things: “Time is money” or “All the world is a stage”. When one of them is unfamiliar or unknown and the other is familiar and known, a metaphor allows us to understand by making connections. A “self-amplifying event” becomes a “chain reaction”, describing perfectly what is going on, a series of reactions connected to each other, with each link of the chain firing off another event.\nAn analogy is similar to a metaphor, it compares two things—the unfamiliar or unknown concept is like a familiar concept. Use this hint to remember the difference between metaphors and analogies: “an analogy is like a metaphor”. If you want to put a finer point on it, then analogies can be distinguished from similes. Both make comparisons via like or as. The goal of the analogy is to provide an explanation, whereas a simile simply says one thing is like another thing. “Life is like a box of chocolate” is a simile.\nWe use metaphors in what follows as an umbrella term for all three, with apologies to linguists.",

Which of the following two phrases is more engaging and memorable?\n\nThe analysis of unstructured data collected through social media suggests\nsignificant customer interest in the update compared to the previous release.\n\n\nA lot of online buzz suggests that customers love the update.\n\nWhen communicating data science to decision makers, you might be running into some resistance. Not everyone has embraced data-based decisioning as the way forward. For many executives, this new way of thinking is an existential threat to the intuition-based decisioning that has led them to their prestigious role. Someone explained the tension around data science this way\n\nData-driven decisioning is considered a threat because based on data and technology you can now make ostensibly better decisions than the folks who have been honing their intuition for 25 years. This empowers a new and younger generation of decision makers to take a seat at the table; disrupting the established order.\n\nIn one of his blog posts Jason Parker lists these attitudes about predictive models as common challenges to overcome:\n\n“There’s nothing this can tell me that I don’t already know.”\n“There’s no way that a machine can replace people in making this kind of decision.”\n“We already do a great job with this, there’s no need to rock the boat.”\n\nThe metaphor he uses to connect with the audience is to compare using a predictive model in business with looking at Google Maps to plan a route home from work. We do it not because we are confused about where Home is, but because the predictive algorithm in Google Maps reliably predicts the shortest route given the current conditions—more so than we can.\nSimilarly, predictive models are not used to tell executives how to run the business, but help them to realize their business goals most efficiently. The analogy is\n\nUsing predictive models is like letting Google suggest a route to a known destination. It is the best way to get to where you want to go.",

    "text": "12.4 Dangerous Metaphors and Analogies\nThe desire to express complex and unfamiliar topics in familiar terms takes us too far when metaphors oversimplify or distort. There be dragons.\nOne of the most controversial analogies in recent data science history is that between neural networks and the brain. Now most of us do not understand how brains work but we are familiar with carrying one around. It is ironic to try and explain a complex and unfamiliar system—the neural network—with an analogy to another system whose functioning is not (well) understood—the human brain.\nSome argue that it should be obvious that an artificial neural network (ANN) does not work like a brain. The numerous contributions that use the analogy to do away with an explanation of the technology by hand-waving suggest otherwise. By calling the units in the hidden layer of an ANN neurons and their connections synapses, comparisons with the brain are invited.\nEver since the analogy between ANN and brain was made, the field had to push back against it. A neural network is a piece of software that does not at all look, work, behave, like a wet-substrate organ. Unfortunately, because the connection was made, and because ANNs are foundational technology in AI applications, the hyperbole about the capabilities and effects of AI had free reign.\nIf the brain analogy of neural networks is out, then what other analogies can be used to relate such a complex and unfamiliar concept?\n\nA neural network is like performing a complex task by enaging thousands or millions of partial experts, each solving a tiny subtask, in anticipation that their collective effort does the job.\n\n\nA neural network is like weaving a garment where the threads are made from data. If the threads or the weaver are not very good you don’t want to wear the garment.",

    "section": "12.5 Analogies for Data Science Concepts",
    "text": "12.5 Analogies for Data Science Concepts\nBehar, Grima, and Marco-Almagro (2013) list 25 analogies the authors use to teach statistical concepts. In this section we draw on some of their analogies, modify and expand on them, and add some of our own.\n\nSample Size\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistical Concept\n\n\n\n\n\nThe appropriate size of a sample is not a function of the size of the population, rather it depends on the variability of the population and the desired accuracy or power of the statistical methods applied to the sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTasting Soup\n\n\n\nImagine cooking a pot of soup and using a teaspoon to taste the soup. If you are expecting more dinner guests and cook a much bigger pot of soup you would not be tasting the soup with a bigger spoon–you would still use a teaspoon.\n\n\nYou can extend this analogy to explain selection bias.\n\n\nSelection Bias\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistical Concept\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling bias–also called selection bias—is a form of representation bias where the sampling method is defective and does not represent the target population. A random sample is always representative of the target population but there are many ways in which the selected data can deviate from the properties of a random sample:\n\nAvailable data can misrepresent the target population, for example, if medical data is only available for individuals having a condition.\nRandom sampling that does not reflect the distribution of groups in the target population, for example, drawing random samples from lists of users (website, mobile phone, phone book, tax records) does not accurately represent the overall population (over-/under-coverage).\nMissing values processes can be related to the objective of the study (non-response bias).\nParticipants who exercise control over their inclusion in a study can bias the data (self-selection bias).\nSurvivorship bias can occur when the sample focuses on those meeting a selection criterion. For example, studying current companies does not reflect companies that have previously failed.\nDrop-out: when subjects drop out of a long-term study for reasons related to the objective of the study it can bias the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStirring the Pot\n\n\n\nSuppose you are tasting soup from a pot that is not well stirred. You might be dipping the spoon into an area where salt or spices have accumulated, thus not getting a representative taste of the entire soup.\nThe problem is not addressed by tasting with a bigger spoon (taking a larger sample), but by making sure the pot is properly stirred prior to tasting.\n\n\n\n\nConfidence Level\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistical Concept\n\n\n\n\n\nThe confidence level is the probability associated with a confidence interval. A 95% confidence interval has confidence level 0.95 and it represents the interval that will contain the unknown value of the parameter in 95% of the conceptual repetitions of the experiment.\nIf you draw a (single) random sample and calculate the confidence level of a parameter based on it, then we do not know whether the parameter will actually be covered by the interval we computed. But we know, were we to repeat the sampling over and over again, that 95% of those intervals will cover the parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Liar\n\n\n\nA 95% confidence interval is like a person who tells the truth 95% of the time. We do not know whether a particular statement is true or not but in the long run, 95% of their statements will be true.\n\n\n\n\nSample (Study) Size and Treatment Effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical Concept\n\n\n\n\n\nA treatment effect of a certain size is more likely detectable as sample size increases as this increases the power of the statistical comparison between the treatments. This can lead to situations where the sample size is so large that treatment differences are detected as significant even though the magnitude of those differences is practically irrelevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagnifying Glasses\n\n\n\nSuppose you are looking at two animals through a magnifying glass. At low magnification you might not be able to tell that one is a dog and one is a cat. As the magnification increases, differences between the animals become more apparent. If you look at them under a microscope you will detect minute dissimilarities and always declare them different individuals. If the question is “Are they both dogs?”, then you do not need a microscope.\n\n\n\n\nResiduals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistical Concept\n\n\n\n\n\nA residual is typically the difference between an observed value and a predicted value under a model; the raw difference is sometimes modified to imbue the residuals with particular properties that aid in the diagnostic of model assumptions. A residual should not exhibit systematic effects as the signal, the systematic part of the relationship between target and input, should have been removed by training a model to the data.\nMany loss functions in statistical estimation are functions of residuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking out the Trash\n\n\n\nAfter reading the newspaper, the pages are thrown into the trash (or are recycled) when we have consumed all the necessary information from the paper. It should not contain any valuable information we overlooked to incorporate into our thinking.\n\n\n\n\nFeature Selection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistical Concept\n\n\n\n\n\nModels depend on features and we cannot include all possible features into a model. Doing so would make the model too large, unwieldy, impractical, and the model would not generalize well. So we use various techniques to choose subsets of the features (variable selection, Lasso) or use regularization techniques that dampen the negative effect of having too many features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHiring Consultants\n\n\n\nSelecting features in a statistical model is like choosing which consultants to hire in order to solve future business problems. (Bear with me here, I know that some will quip that the correct number of consultants to be hired is always zero.)\nYou cannot afford to hire all consultants, and they would likely trip all over each other anyway. So you choose to bring the best two or three you can afford. The first consultant you choose should be the one with the broadest knowledge base because you cannot know yet what future problems they will need to solve. Suppose that this consultant can handle 65% of all problems.\nWhich consultant should you hire next? The one with the second-most breadth in problem solving—say 45% or the one whose problem-solving ability covers the blind spots of the first (is orthogonal to the first consultant)? You are making the company most future-proof by hiring second the consultant who knows most about the problems the first consultant does not know anything about.\n\n\n\n\nType-I and Type-II Errors\nFeinberg (1971) uses analogies with the judicial process to explain the concepts of the Type-I and Type-II errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistical Concept\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are testing a hypothesis, called the null hypothesis, by gathering data and examining how likely the outcome of the experiment is under the hypothesis (if the null hypothesis were true). If the outcome is very unlikely under this condition the null hypothesis is rejected—as the outcome should not have happened. A Type-I error is the mistake to reject a true hypothesis. A Type-II error is to fail to reject in the situation when the null hypothesis is not true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Court Trial\n\n\n\nConsider a trial before court. The hypothesis is that the accused is innocent of the charges—following the principle of presumption of innocence: in the absence of evidence against, we have to assume that the defendant is innocent.\n\nA Type-I error is to find a defendant guilty when in fact they are innocent.\nA Type-II error occurs if the court fails to declare the defendant guilty when they in fact broke the law.\n\n\n\nThe analogy can be continued to explain the significance level and the inverse relationship between the two error types.\n\n\nSignificance level\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistical Concept\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decision about the validity of a null hypothesis based on statistical analysis rests on estimated quantities that have variability. We cannot say whether a hypothesis is true or false, we can only make statements about the probability of having observed the result we did (or a result more extreme) if the hypothesis were true. The probability threshold at which we we are confident to state that a result is unusual enough for the hypothesis to be a viable explanation is the significance level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourt Trial\n\n\n\nIn order to convict someone, we need evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to reduce the chance to declare an innocent person guilty (a Type-I error). By raising the bar of reasonable doubt for a conviction, we make sure that it is unlikely to convict an innocent person. But at the same time we are increasing the chances that a guilty person will go free (a Type-II error). This happens when there is evidence against the guilty person but it does not rise to the level of beyond reasonable doubt required for a conviction.\n\n\n\n\nRegularization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistical Concept\n\n\n\n\n\nRegularization is a form of shrinkage estimation where a penalty term is added to an objective function. The regularization penalty has the effect of introducing bias while reducing variability at the same time, leading to smaller mean-squared errors compared to unbiased methods. The parameter estimates of regularized models are shrunk toward zero—sometimes made exactly zero—which reduces their variability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWise Teacher\n\n\n\nRegularization is like a wise teacher. After you have read many books on a subject, the teacher can tell you which ones matter most and encourage you not to take any of the sources too serious.\n\n\n\n\nLoss Function\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistical Concept\n\n\n\n\n\nA loss function measures the cost of committing an error in a supervised estimation method, in the sense that the observed and predicted values will disagree to some extent. The form of the loss function expresses how we measure and value these cost.\nLoss functions are objective functions we try to minimize in statistical estimation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching\n\n\n\nA loss function is like a teacher comparing a student’s response to a question to the correct answer. The goal is not to get all questions correct by remembering the answers, but for the student to learn and gain knowledge that they can apply to find answers to new questions.\nThe loss function tells the teacher how far off an individual student is, how far off the entire class is, and whether further instruction is needed.\n\n\n\n\nBias-Variance Tradeoff\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistical Concept\n\n\n\n\n\nThe contributions to the mean-squared error by a statistical estimator have two sources: the variability of the estimator itself, and its bias, the deviation between the mean of the estimator and the target of estimation. The mean-squared error is the sum of the variance and the squared bias.\nAn estimator can achieve a small mean-squared error by having small variance and/or having small bias. In constructing statistical models using supervised learning we balance bias and variance by making sure models do not overfit (low bias and high variance) or underfit (high bias and low variance) and by choosing appropriate model families and estimation principles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn to Office (RTO)\n\n\n\nBalancing bias and variance in data science models is like maximizing employee productivity by finding the balance between remote working and spending time in the office.\n\n\n\n\nEnsemble Method\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistical Concept\n\n\n\n\n\nAn ensemble is a collection of weak or strong learning models that produce a prediction or classification collectively, usually by some form of averaging or majority voting. The combination of base learners improves performance by reducing variability through averaging, or by sequentially improving on previous models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisdom of Crowds\n\n\n\nAn ensemble method is like estimating the number of marbles in a jar by relying on the wisdom of crowds. Any one person’s guess is unreliable, but when you average many person’s guesses you can estimate the number of marbles well.\nNo one person has to be an expert at marble guessing for the group to do well.",

    "text": "12.6 Terms with Established Meaning\nAnother issue to look out for in technical communication are terms that have established meaning in everyday language which can be different from their meaning in technical vernacular.\nAn error in everyday English refers to a mistake. In statistics, error has multiple meanings:\n\nthe discrepancy between an observation and a model prediction (mean-squared error, classification error)\nthe discrepancy between a true value and an observed value (measurement error)\nthe amount of loss incurred\na probable interval (margin of error)\na measure of variability (standard error)\nan erroneous decision (Type-I error, Type-II error)\n\nTo statisticians it might be perfectly clear which type of error you are referring to. Given the many meanings of the term in statistics, that is not guaranteed. Imagine the confusion of a non-technical audience.\nSignificance in everyday English refers to something important, worthy of attention. Statistical significance is a threshold level of probability beyond which an assumption (the hypothesis) is deemed unlikely to be true. This threshold is not related to practical importance. Non-technical audiences are easily misled into thinking that findings matter if they have found to be statistically significant. Better words to use in technical writing are remarkable, important, and relevant.\nCorrelation in everyday English refers to the relationship or connection between things. In statistical terms, the correlation is a measure of a particular type of relationship between random variables, a linear relationship. Replacing the word correlation in technical writing with association or the generic relationship is a good idea.\nIndependence in everyday language is a state of freedom, being free of the control of others. In statistics and probability, independence is a property of the joint distribution of random variables. Two events are stochastically independent when the occurrence of one event does not affect the likelihood that the other event occurs. In modeling, the term independent variable is also common, as compared to the dependent variable. Independent variables are the explanatory variables (predictors, inputs) in a model. The dependent variable is the target. The use of the terms independent variables and dependent variable is particularly confusing to non-technical audiences.\n\n\n\n\nAwati, Kailash, and Simon Buckingham Shum. 2015. “Big Data Metaphors We Live By.” Medium. https://towardsdatascience.com/big-data-metaphors-we-live-by-98d3fa44ebf8.\n\n\nBehar, Roberto, Pere Grima, and Lluís Marco-Almagro. 2013. “Twenty-Five Analogies for Explaining Statistical Concepts.” The American Statistician 67: 44–48.\n\n\nFeinberg, William E. 1971. “Teaching the Type i and Type II Errors: The Judicial Process.” The American Statistician 25 (3): 30–32. http://www.jstor.org/stable/2683322.",

A group is presented with the following resources\nThe goal is to build with these materials in a limited amount of time (18 minutes) a tower that is as tall as possible with the marshmallow sitting on top.\nThe fascinating aspect of the experiments by Skillman is that different groups were asked to build the spaghetti tower and they performed very differently: CEOs, lawyers, business school students, and recent kindergarten graduates. In trial after trial, kindergartners built towers that were taller (26 inches) than the average tower (20 inches), handily beating lawyers (15 inches) and business school students (10 inches!).\nTom Wujec has conducted about 70 marshmallow challenges across the world, as he reports in his TED talk\nWujec explains that kindergartners are not only building taller towers, their structures are also more interesting. Are we suggesting to throw out architecture and engineering and build bridges, airports, and railway systems like kindergartners? No. Thankfully, the very tallest spaghetti towers that supported a marshmallow were built by architects and engineers. Phew.\nBut the experiment raises many interesting questions:\nThere are a few reasons why the kindergartners outperformed the business students. They have to do with the approach to problem solving and how the team operates\nKindergartners start building without following a single construction plan. They try things and fail quickly, moving from one prototype to another prototype. They listen to each other and are ready to try out someone’s idea. They cooperate and offer each other help. They start constructing the tower immediately, wasting no time on figuring out how the team operates or who is in charge.\nThe business school students are taught to find the solution to a problem, to have a definite plan before implementing anything. Like the kindergartners they also went right to work. But rather than building, they examined the materials, thinking strategically, discussing options. They spend most of the 18 minutes developing the optimal plan on how to build the tower. Once they start the actual construction, they have no time to correct and start over if the plan turns out to be flawed. They also waste time on figuring out the rules of engagements (is it OK to criticize?) and their place in the group (who is in charge?): status management. What appears on the surface as a collaborative environment is actually a competitive situation.\nAs Coyle puts it\nThe marshmallow is a metaphor for the hidden assumptions in a project. In this case, the assumption that a marshmallow is light and can be easily supported by a bunch of spaghetti. Many teams thus ignore the marshmallow until the end, when they place it on the tower as the last piece of the project. In reality, it turns out the marshmallow is quite heavy and placing it atop of a poorly constructed spaghetti tower can bring down the entire structure—at the very moment that should have defined success.\nEvery project has these hidden assumptions, the things you assume to be true without hesitation and without checking. Internet is available. Turning on the faucet dispenses water. The marshmallow weighs next-to-nothing. If what we take for granted does not come true, projects can fail spectacularly.",

    "section": "13.2 Dysfunctions of a Team",
    "text": "13.2 Dysfunctions of a Team\nIn The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, Patrick M. Lencioni tells the fable of a new CEO taking over a start-up company (Lencioni 2002). After observing the executive team for several weeks, she calls them to an off-site and introduces them to her analysis. She had noticed five dysfunctions in how the executive team was operating (Figure 13.2).\n\nAbsence of Trust. The failure on the part of team members to understand and open up to one another. This is not touchy-feely; great teams are honest with each others and are able to talk about their weaknesses, failures, and concerns without fear of reprisal. What gets in the way is our fear of vulnerability; the evidence of the dysfunction is invulnerability in the team.\nFear of Conflict. In the absence of trust, teams do not engage in open, honest and constructive conflict. The evidence of the dysfunction is artificial harmony and tension. Instead of engaging in honest dialog about issues and concerns, opinions are held back to preserve harmony. Veiled discussions and guarded comments result.\nLack of Commitment. Constructive conflict is important so that the team can develop a plan that everyone commits to and buys into it. When people cannot have their voices heard and their opinions considered, they will not get on board. It is not about getting consensus, it is about a culture to disagree and commit. The evidence of the dysfunction is ambiguity.\nAvoidance of Accountability. Holding each other accountable to achieve the team goals, once there is clarity and buy-in about the goals, is difficult because team members are often peers. When people are not committed to the goals, they will try to avoid accountability (“I did not agree to this anyway”) and not hold others accountable. The evidence of this dysfunction is low standards.\nInattention to Results. This is the ultimate dysfunction: seeking out individual recognition and attention at the expense of collective results. The dysfunction thrives in environments without accountability. The results the team needs to achieve need to be so clear that no team member would consider actions that would only enhance their individual status or ego. Anything that diminishes achieving the collective goals makes the entire team lose. When it is ambiguous what the team is supposed to achieve as a collective, it is easy to fall back on focusing on individual success. The evidence of the dysfunction is concern about individual status and ego.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.2: Five dysfucntions of a team. After Lencioni (2002).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Experience\n\n\n\n\n\nI was faced with building a leadership team in an organization that was used to a very different leadership style, where the team rarely met as a group. Instead, the CEO would have one-on-one conversations with the executives. After a re-org, some of those executives were now reporting to me.\nAlthough I had not read the book by Lencioni at the time, I recognized all five dysfunctions in my direct reports. There was a lack of trust, folks did not engage openly with each others. There was a lot of politicking, positioning, and finger-pointing (absence of trust). On the surface, interactions were professional and cordial, covering the tension that existed between the teams (fear of conflict). There had not been a business plan for the entire organization, rather each team muddled along by themselves, setting its on goals in the spirit of what they thought was best for the company (lack of commitment and avoidance of accountability). The “first team” of the leadership members was their own organization, not the leadership team. Goals and results were set for their organization, quietly assuming that this would be for the benefit of the company as a whole (inattention to results). Status, ego, and standing with the CEO were currencies. Some team members did not see the other executives as peers, believing they should be given more weight because they were driving revenue, or were interacting with customers, or had more headcount, or …; fill in the blanks.\nTo make the leadership operate as a leadership team, a number of changes were put into place. Chief among them,\n\nOwning company goals together.\nCompensation plans that spelled out explicitly how variable compensation (bonus) achievement is tied to common goals and to individual goals.\nTreating all members of the leadership as peers by virtue of reporting to me, regardless of title or tenure.\n“Disagree and commit” policy. We argue as a team about best path forward, but when a decision is made, everyone defends the decision as if it had been their idea.\nNo finger pointing rule. Instead of blaming your organization’s shortcomings on another team (“I could sell more if I had better product”), you have to offer your organization’s help to the other team, ask “how can I help?”",

    "section": "13.3 Three Questions",
    "text": "13.3 Three Questions\nThe performance of a team does depend on skill and experience of the team members. But those attributes by themselves do not guarantee a successful team either. It also depends on team culture. And as the famous management consultant Peter Drucker said\n\nCulture eats strategy for breakfast.\n\nIf you do not pay attention to culture, your best strategy is toast. A toxic team culture diminishes team performance and makes us miserable.\nViewed from the outside, teams with great culture have an enviable chemistry that appears like magic. It is not magic, it is something that can be created, it is something that can be done. Strong cultures are built on interactions and our social needs. They have in common to offer a safe space where trust is built by shared vulnerability and a shared purpose.\n\nSafety\nOur unconscious brains are obsessed with psychological safety. Constantly worrying about whether we are safe in this group, where the dragons lie, whether we have a future with these people. We are looking for belonging cues that signal a safe space: eye contact, physical contact, being listened to, feeling invested in, feeling valued.\nOnce we feel safe, we can stop spending energy on worrying whether the social system rejects us and can focus on what the group is supposed to accomplish.\nIf you observe your own team or another team, ask yourself three questions:\n\nWho talks? In high-performing teams, everyone talks and listens in similar proportions. Leaders do not occupy the conversation, they gather information from others.\nHow does information flow? Are side conversations (“back channels”) and conversations outside the team accepted and encouraged? Does information from those conversations flow back to the team?\nHow does communication work? Is there a lot of eye contact or are folks looking at their shoes when talking to each other? Do team members communicate with each other or does all communication go through the team leader?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Shoes\n\n\n\nThere is a silly joke about the difference between introverts and extroverts. You can tell the difference between an introvert and an extrovert by observing which shoes they look at during a conversation. The Lencioni_2002introvert looks at their own shoes, the extrovert looks at your shoes.\n\n\n\n\nVulnerability\nVulnerability can have different meanings. A farmer is vulnerable to flood and drought, an endangered species is vulnerable to habitat loss, a first grader is vulnerable to bullying by someone in a higher grade. This type of vulnerability describes being in a state where one can be easily attacked or harmed.\nVulnerability is also an emotion that we experience during times of uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure (Brown 2018). In Brené Brown’s words:\n\nVulnerability is not winning or losing. It is the courage to show up when you can’t control the outcome.\n\nWhy does vulnerability matter in the performance of teams?\nVulnerability is not about oversharing (TMI!) or disclosing details of one’s private life. It is about signaling that you are open to receive help and feedback, that you have weaknesses and that you are not clad with armor in your interactions. It is a powerful mechanism to break down barriers, to create connection, and to build trust.\nFake vulnerability does not work. It has the opposite effect, it breeds distrust. I once worked for a leader who was trying to manipulate with vulnerability: “C’mon folks, tell me what you think of my idea; I am completely vulnerable here.” Except, he wasn’t vulnerable, he was not open to input, and was only interested in affirmation of his idea.\nVulnerability sounds mushy, touchy-feely; it is anything but that. And it is most certainly not a weakness. Showing up when you cannot control the outcome is not a weakness. Standing in front of an audience to give a presentation is not a weakness. Waiting for the call from the doctor after the biopsy is not a weakness. Giving someone honest feedback that their performance is lacking and putting skin into the game to help them improve is not a weakness. Showing empathy when you inform an employee that they are not a good fit and\ntoday is their last day with the organization is not a weakness.\nThe powerful aspect of vulnerability is its link to cooperation and trust. By sending a genuine vulnerability signal, the receiver is encouraged to send a vulnerability signal back and trust increases. A safe zone is established that allows sender and receiver to cooperate more freely. This loop is contagious and travels through rooms and teams.\nIf you observe your own team or another team, ask yourself three questions:\n\nWhat are the openness signals? How is trust and cooperation established? Do you notice that it has been built in the past? How are new team members integrated into the group? Vulnerability signals can be subtle, an invitation to contribute ideas, a request for feedback, asking to “tell me more”.\nHow does feedback work? Giving and receiving feedback are very vulnerable moments. We try to please and avoid getting someone’s feeling hurt. We try to protect ourselves from judgment and rejection. During a performance review your manager tells you 36 things you did great and one thing you could improve on. It is that one thing you take away from the review and it bothers you to no end.\n\nIs feedback given and received with care and empathy or is it given to establish hierarchy? Do team members acknowledge and act on feedback? Do team members feel safe bringing up ideas and how are these received?\nAre the boundaries understood? Vulnerability does not mean anything goes, anything can be said, and any behavior is tolerated. Does everyone know what is okay and what is not okay?\n\n\n\nPurpose\nWhen working with teams I often asked them three questions to learn about their purpose:\n\nWhat is your product? The product can be a customer-facing item or an internal deliverable. There should be some form of output that the team can point to: “This is what we do!” Even if the purpose of a team is to develop ideas, the ideas are the product. If you do not produce anything, what is the purpose of doing what you are doing?\nWho is your customer? Every team works for someone or something. How is the product picked up and what happens to it afterwards? If the product falls on the floor and nobody picks it up, what is the purpose of doing what you are doing?\nWhat does success look like? How do you measure whether you and the team performed adequately, below, or above expectations? What are the expectations?\n\nIf you find yourself on a team that is unsure about what it is they are working on, not clear who or what it is for–if anything, and it is not clear what a good job looks like: get out!\n\n\n\nFigure 13.1: Tools for the marshmallow challenge (spaghetti tower).\n\n\n\nBrown, Brené. 2018.

    "text": "14.1 Introduction\nFrom The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Lencioni (2002) we know the importance of engaging in productive, ideological, and honest debate and conflict. The single most important arena for conflict and conflict resolution in teams is the meeting.\nIf we want to work on high-performing teams—who doesn’t?—then we should look forward to being in meetings. Yet the opposite is true: we dread meetings. We dread them because they are boring, we dread them because so many are a waste of time (the meeting that could have been an e-mail), keeping us from more important and interesting things. We dread them because they can be acrimonious, uncomfortable, stressful. We dread the status posturing and pontificating by some people while others are trying not to get stuck with extra work as the result of the meeting.\nLencioni (2002) asks an interesting question: why do we prefer going to a movie rather than a meeting? After all, movies are typically longer than meetings, they are not interactive, you cannot engage with the actors on screen, you cannot speak up or comment in the theater. Movies have no direct impact on our lives. You might feel like a superhero when leaving the theater, but the movie has not turned you into one; the feeling wears off. Meetings, on the other hand, can have a direct impact on our lives, personally and professionally.\nIf meetings were more like movies, would we enjoy them more? The one thing all movies worth watching have in common is, …, wait for it, conflict. The flaws and internal struggles that connect us to the character. Buzz Lightyear is a toy that does not realize he is a toy. Shrek struggles against being seen as a horrible outcast, an ogre. James Bond struggles against Blofeld, Largo, or Dr. No. The resolution of the struggle creates suspense.\nMeetings that are more like movies are loaded with conflict. That does not mean shooting at each other across the room or an outbreak of fisticuffs, but an honest debate of something worth debating.",

At the heart of the data science project are multiple communication steps. A business problem is communicated to you; it needs to be translated (another communication activity) into a data science context from which a data science solution is developed. The solution must be translated into the relevant business context and communicated back to the stakeholders.\nAt the beginning you draw on listening skills and the ability to ask the right\\(\\texttrademark\\) questions. When presenting the solution to stakeholders you draw on speaking, writing, visualization, and presentation skills.\nData scientists, statisticians, and other data professionals are not known for their communication skills, making these fundamental exchanges frustrating for both sides.\n\nWhy did they not ask about the goals of the project and how success is measured?\n\n\nHow does “significance” in their mind translate into business relevance?\n\nImproving communication skills raises your confidence as a data professional and enables you to interact more confidently with others.

The paper claimed to establish cause and effect relationship between the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine and colitis and between colitis and autism. This paper is the source of the imagined relationship between vaccines and autism.\nThe study caused a public stir and resulted in a decline in vaccinations, which in turn led to deadly measles outbreaks around the world.\nOther researchers were not able to reproduce and confirm the paper’s findings. It was disclosed that Wakefield had a financial interest worth several million dollars per year selling test kits. In 2010 it was found that Wakefield had been dishonest in the research, that portions of the study were falsified, and that The Lancet had been deceived. The journal fully retracted the study, Wakefield recanted and lost his medical license.\nIt took 12 years of energy to refute the bullshit Wakefield produced in a single paper. Conspiracy theories about the connection between vaccines and autism are still swirling today. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services hired in March 2025 vaccine critic David Greier, who holds no medical credentials, to conduct a study on the link of vaccines and autism—long after the link has been debunked.\nIt seems that we still need to spend more energy to refute the bullshit.\n\n\nIn 2020, researchers studied the sensitivity to bullshit and found that\n\npeople are more receptive to bullshit, and less sensitive to detecting bullshit, under conditions in which they possess relatively few self-regulatory resources.",

    "section": "4.4 Modes of Intelligence",
    "text": "4.4 Modes of Intelligence\nGardner (1983) coined the idea of multiple intelligences. Rather than a single, general intelligence, human intelligence is made up of different modalities (Figure 4.3). The modalities most associated with the traditional notion of general intelligence are the linguistic and the logical-mathematical intelligences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Intelligence modalities. Source: Wikipedia. Naturalistic intelligence was not part of the initial seven modes and was added later.\n\n\n\nThe intelligences (modalities) express themselves as skills or competencies. Someone with high linguistic intelligences learns languages easily and enjoys reading, writing, and storytelling. Someone with well-developed interpersonal intelligence will be able to sense other’s moods and intentions, they have high empathy.\nCritics of the theory of multiple intelligences object to using the term intelligence to describe what they consider to be just abilities, talents, or aptitudes. The theory conflates personality, talent, and learning style and there is no experimental data to back up the categorization. Further, Gardner’s theory is based on low correlations between the modes of intelligence, as if they are almost orthogonal. The correlations between different aspects of intelligence are typically strong, however, supporting the idea of a general intelligence.\nDespite the criticism, the theory of modes of intelligences is helpful to us in several ways.\n\nIt helps us to understand the abilities of others and how to adjust mode of communication for the benefit of the recipient. If you are communicating to people who work daily with maps (spatial intelligence), making your point by presenting text or tables adds extra cognitive burden.\nIt helps to recognize how different abilities are being used in solving data science problems. Except for the naturalistic and musical intelligences, you will likely be challenged as a data scientist to exercise all modes of intelligence. The diversity of thoughts and ways of looking at a problem is a strength of teams.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: The modalities of multiple intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMode\nSkills\nData Science Relevance\n\n\n\n\nVerbal-Linguistic\nSensitivity to words and their meaning.

    "text": "4.5 Computational Kindness\n\nThe Principle\nComputational kindness is a concept and principle introduced in Christian and Griffiths (2017). It asks us to consider the cognitive (computational) burden in interactions with others. This consideration is obviously relevant to how we communicate with others.\nIn designing functions and algorithms, computer scientists worry a great deal about computational complexity, the resources required to carry out a computational task. Particular attention is paid to the number of operations required (time complexity), the memory requirements (space complexity) or the amount of data exchanged over the network (communication complexity). For example, search algorithms are ranked in terms of their time complexity—using O-notation. The complexity of the best algorithm that solves a problem is the complexity of the problem.\nThe underlying idea is that computation should be minimized—computation is bad. It is bad to compute more than necessary, require more memory than necessary, communicate with other machines more than necessary. In other words, the underlying principle is to minimize the labor of thought, to minimize the computational burden.\nThis principle translates very well into how we make decisions and design systems in real life. You are computationally kind when you are respectful of the cognitive problems you force others to solve. Figure 4.4 shows digital signage at a bus stop that has a low cognitive burden; it is computationally kind. The arrival times, even if estimated, of the next six buses visiting the stop are shown in order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: A bus stop with digital signage that lowers cognitive burden\n\n\n\nIf I am waiting for the Number 12 bus, and stopping at the coffee shop nearby takes 5 minutes, I can be assured that I will not miss the bus should I opt for a latte now. The cognitive burden of this sign is much lower than that of Figure 4.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: A bus stop sign in Paris, France.\n\n\n\nAs Christian and Griffiths (2017) put it,\n\nWe can be “computationally kind” to others by framing issues in terms that make the underlying computational problem easier.\n\n\n\nKind but not Polite\nComputational kindness and politeness can be at odds.\nEtiquette suggests to figure out how to spend the evening out by asking\n\n“What do you want to do tonight?”\n\nThe question places the cognitive burden of the decision on the other party. That is called “passing the cognitive buck”. They now have to figure out your preferences unless you will go along with their decision or they do not care to consider your preferences. It is computationally more kind to constrain the problem presented to the other party. You can state your preferences—“I want to go to a movie”—or provide a limited set of options to choose from:\n\n“Let’s go to McDonald’s or Taco Bell followed by either a movie or playing pool at the sports bar.”\n\nComputational kindness reduces mental burden but can be detrimental to your relationships.\nWhy are folks more likely to schedule meetings when you ask\n\n“Can you meet tomorrow at 10 am?”\n\ninstead of\n\n“What days and times next week are convenient for you?”\n\nThe answer lies in the mental burden to craft a response. The first question specifies constraints of the solution space. Now I do not have to spend mental energy going through the open slots in my calendar, assemble a list of possible days and times for a meeting, send them back to the inquirer and wait for a response. All I have to do is check my calendar against a narrow constraint: tomorrow at 10 am. The first question is computationally kind, reducing mental burden by adding a constraint. Asking what days and times are convenient is computationally cruel.\nThe more polite response when someone tries to schedule with you is to say “I am flexible”. It is also the computationally most cruel one because it passes the buck of computation to the inquirer. They have to do all the work to narrow down the large number of possibilities. Saying “I can do Monday at 2 pm and Wednesday at 4 pm” is computationally kind because it constrains the requester to two options. And if neither of those work they will come back with another day and time—which you can likely accept because you are flexible.\n\nOur brains are sophisticated computing machines. If we design algorithms to make the best use of resources, then we can also strive to make everyday tasks more computationally friendly to our brain. Opportunities are everywhere.\n\nRestaurant policies to secure a table have very different levels of mental labor. An open seating policy means whoever gets to an open table first gets to sit down. Customers will hover, constantly checking on which tables might open up, anxiously awaiting their turn. A policy where patron check-in upon arrival, can visit the bar, and are being told when their table opens up has a much lower cognitive burden for the patron, but is less computationally kind on the restaurant.\n\nA reservation service that guarantees you a table has the lowest stress level for the patron and the highest computational burden for the restaurant. Unless the restaurant knows how to take a reservation but not how to hold a reservation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAirline boarding policies. First-come-first serve versus assigned groups that board the plane from the back.\nThe bus stop that announces the arrival time of the buses versus one that makes you guess and wait.\nNavigating a cluttered website with too much information and repeated ads versus a clean design where information is easy to find.\nAssembly instructions that are written in some Klingon dialect.\nAmazon’s 1-Click online buying system reduced the cognitive load of ordering online. With a shipping address and a credit card stored in the profile, you can check out the items in the shopping cart with a single click on the website.\n\n\n\nAssignment: Designing a Parking Lot\n\n\nYou are operating a mall or large venue and are designing a parking lot for visitors of the space. Four designs are being proposed:\n\nA standard grid of lanes leading away from the venue with parking spaces on both sides of the lane.\nA standard multi-story parking deck.\nA single lane leading away from the venue with parking spaces on both sides of the lane.\nA helix-type structure that winds upward from the ground level where the venue is located. Parking spaces are accessed directly from the helix.\n\n\nRank the four designs in terms of computational kindness to drivers.\nAre parking lot designs you find in real life paying attention to computational kindness considerations?\nCan you think of other designs or technologies that balance the tradeoff between mental labor of finding a parking spot and convenience?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Communication\nIn communication we want to be computationally kind without being impolite. We want to minimize cognitive load for the communicator and the recipient of information—particularly for the latter. We want to reduce the mental effort required to receive communication and to respond to it.\nThe benefits are clearer and more engaging communication, better understanding and collaboration, less frustration, more trust and collaboration.\nHere are some ways to be kind in communication:\n\nBe mindful of how questions are asked. Avoid open-ended questions such as “What do you think?” or “Questions, comments, concerns?”. Instead ask specific questions such as “Is retention or revenue the main driver of the project?” Provide options to choose from.\nBe mindful of the recipient’s understanding. Avoid jargon and technical terms that might not be understood. Do not assume that terms familiar to the data scientist are familiar to the recipient.\nConsider the needs and perspective of the recipient.\nAsk clarifying questions and be specific. Rather than asking “Does this make sense?” ask “Did I convey the difference between statistical and practical significance?”\nDo not overload visualizations with unnecessary detail such as chart junk, excessive labeling and annotations. Use presentation graphs for presentations, not exploratory visualizations.\nRely on pre-attentive attributes in visualizations to let the audience understand the contents intuitively, rather than having to think about it.\nUse storytelling (Chapter 3).\nDo not make the audience read text on slides. Do not read the text on slides yourself.\nWhen using PowerPoint or other slide-making tools, use the assertion–evidence format for slides. A headline-style title provides the assertion of the slide, the important message being conveyed. The remainder of the slide consists of few bullets (if any) and visuals that provide evidence of the assertion.\nAvoid “eye charts”. Graphics and tables are not meant to test the visual acuity of the audience.\nLimit the number of items the audience has to hold in their head to 3–5.\nConsider the person behind the screen: written communication does not benefit from face-to-face contact so choose words wisely—especially when using digital channels such as email, messaging services, social media.\nBe mindful of time zones in electronic communication. Nobody wants to see an email at 9:30 pm (or 5:00 am) marked High Importance because you did not remember that you are on a global team.\nUse active listening. Try to hear what is being said rather than waiting for your chance or turn to speak (Chapter 10).\nUse metaphors, analogies, and similes to explain technical concepts (Chapter 12).\nPay attention. To the audience, to the environment, and to yourself (Chapter 11).\nPractice (the individual skills) and rehearse (in a real setting).\nDo not Reply All to emails unless that is what you really really need to do. When folks erroneously reply to all recipients do not Reply All to tell them to stop. That is known as the Reply All Apocalypse.\n\n\nReply all: Please everyone, stop hitting reply all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Reply All Kitten\n\n\n\n\nNot unlike the restaurant reservation example, creating communication that is computationally kind to the recipient can increase mental burden for the communicator. We have to spend more time and effort crafting compelling visuals rather than copy-paste from a paper to a slide deck. We have to craft stories rather than reciting facts. We have to practice and rehearse to give an extemporaneous speech.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: The 5-Why framework for root cause analysis.\nFigure 4.4: A bus stop with digital signage that lowers cognitive burden\n\n\n\nChristian, Brian, and Tom Griffiths. 2017.

    "section": "8.2 Cultural Expectations",
    "text": "8.2 Cultural Expectations\nNonverbal cues are particularly important in intercultural situations. The term culture is interpreted very broadly here, the influences that shape a person’s expectations for communications. The different cultural interpretation of nonverbal cues is responsible for much mis-communication. What is acceptable or even expected behavior in one culture can be offensive in another culture. For example, loudness of voice indicates strength in Arabic cultures, confidence and authority in Germany, impoliteness in Thailand, and loss of control to the Japanese.\nThe OK gesture (👌), performed by joining the thumb and index finger in a circle, is frequently used as a sign of approval or assent, indicating something positive and well done. In Japan the sign is meant to represent a coin and indicates wealth. In many other cultures the gesture has a negative and offensive connotation: it can represent a zero (or nothing of value), a vulgar expression symbolizing the human anus (as in “you a**hole”), a homophobic reaction. The Anti-Defamation League added the OK gesture in 2019 to its “Hate on Display” database, as it has been used as an expression of white supremacy.\n\nInterpretations Vary\nHere is a list of nonverbal cues with complicated cultural interpretations, based in part on teaching notes by Dr Charles Tidwell of Andrews University.\n\nPosture\n\nBowing: is not done in the U.S., shows respect and social rank in many Asian cultures.\nHands in pocket: considered disrespectful in Turkey\nSitting with legs crossed: offensive in Turkey, Ghana\nShowing soles of feet: a sign of disrespect in Arab, Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist countries\n\nFacial Expressions. Facial expressions that relate to anger, sorrow, sadness, happiness have the same meaning world wide, but their intensity differs between cultures. Too much smiling can be seen as a sign of shallowness. Many Asian cultures limit facial expressions.\nEye Contact. This one is tricky, because we are taught in Western cultures that eye contact is generally a positive thing and we are aware that many communicators do not make enough eye contact with their audience (looking at the floor, looking at their slides, etc.). Across cultures direct and/or sustained eye contact is interpreted very differently.\n\nWestern cultures: eye contact is generally seen as positive, a sign of engagement and attentiveness. However, too much eye contact appears aggressive, prolonged eye contact can be seen as a sign of sexual interest—no staring!\nArabic cultures: prolonged eye contact shows interest and establishes trust. Not reciprocating eye contact makes a person seen as not trustworthy.\nIn many Asian and Latin American cultures, avoiding eye contact or averting gaze is seen as a sign of respect.\nIn many East Asian cultures (Japan, Korea, China) direct eye contact is a sign of disrespect, especially when speaking to someone of high(er) status. In Japanese culture, sustained eye contact is seen as a challenge or an expression of dominance rather than a sign of engagement or attentiveness.\n\nTouch. Touch is culturally determined, the basic message when touching someone is to exercise control and to affect someone. The safe thing is not to have any physical contact when interacting with others. A handshake is a common part of a greeting in Western cultures, but no-touch greetings or less-touch greetings such as a fist bump are more acceptable. Expecting a handshake can be awkward when the other party does not reciprocate. For example, some interpretations of Islam and Judaism discourage or prohibit shaking hands with members of the opposite sex unless they are close relatives or spouses.\n\nIf someone wants to greet you with a handshake and you’d rather not have physical contact, it is fine to greet them with a nod and a smile.\n\nDerr (2000) gives the following recommendations when meeting someone who might have a different cultural background–and thus different nonverbal expectations:\n\nFirst impressions are nonverbal, and they have a cultural context\nUnderstand the expectations for your culture (typical greeting, eye contact, inter-personal distance)\nLearn about the expectations in cultures you interact with professionally\nWhen possible, adopt your behavior to the audience’s expectations\nIf you get a negative first impression of someone, consider that their expectations for nonverbal communication might be different from yours\nLook out for discomfort in your audience, it will get in the way of the information you are trying to communicate\n\n\n\nBusiness Card Etiquette\nBusiness cards are used less frequently today in the U.S., but they still play a role when doing business across country borders. Especially in Asia, business cards are important, considered an extension of the person. Mishandling a business card is a sign of mishandling and disrespecting the person the card represents.\nIf you interact with Chinese, Korean, or Japanese professionally, you should know the cultural expectations around business cards, especially if you are in a more senior position as higher-ranking representatives exchange cards first.\nIn China, Korea, and Japan, business cards should be in English on one side and in the local language on the other side. Business cards are always kept in a special card case, never just stashed into a pocket. Receiving someone’s card and putting it in your back pocket is a major faux pas, you are signaling the\nperson that you will be sitting on them soon.\nEspecially in Japan and Korea, the exchange of business cards is a ceremony. Cards are exchanged on first meeting, both parties are standing up, facing each other. The presenter holds their card with both hands, facing toward the recipient with the translated side up. The exchange is accompanied by a bow and a vocal introduction of who you are and your job title. The recipient takes the card with both hands, reads it, and often comments on an aspect of the person as gleaned from the card. This exchange takes time.\nThe recipient then places the card on the top of a card case or on the table in front of them when meeting around a conference table. The first card should be presented to the most senior staff member, working down the hierarchy after that. Remember, the card is an extension of the person; how you treat the card is how you treat the person.",

Effective communication works from the inside-out, starting with Why we are doing what we are doing–the thing or purpose that drives us.\n\nA common element of these storytelling models is to make an emotional connection early in the communication process:\n\nThe Golden Circle.

    "text": "8.6 Other Communication Channels\nNonverbal communication also plays an important role when you cannot see the person you are communicating with. Text messages and email, for example, are forms of verbal communication because you type out words. They also have nonverbal cues such as emojis, punctuation, capitalization, slang, response length and time. A quick reply can suggest enthusiasm, long response times can indicate disinterest. Use of periods, question marks, and exclamation points can add clarity to the message and indicate tone and emphasis. Emojis are a substitute for facial expressions and body language, allowing the sender to express emotion.\nTone of voice, pitch, volume, inflection, pace of speech, breathing, silences are called paralinguisitics and are the nonverbal cues you can use when speaking to someone you cannot see. When phones first became more widely available, phone courtesy was lacking. People were not used to speaking without seeing the other person. Employees berated their bosses on the phone because the typical cues that established hierarchy (office, desk, suit, appearance) and conditioned behavior were not visible.\nThe following nonverbal cues affect phone communication:\n\nA calm and friendly voice creates a sense of trust and professionalism.\nDo not speak too fast, normal rate of speech is about 125 words per minute.\nStrategic silences allow the other person to process information, but prolonged silences create awkwardness.\nActive listening can be shown with phrases such as “mm-hmm” or “I understand”.\nAlthough the recipient cannot see you smile, smiling while speaking influences your tone of voice, you sound more friendly. Siting upright or standing also affects your tone of voice.\n\n\n\n\n\nDerr, Janice. 2000. Statistical Consulting: A Guide to Effective Communication. Duxbury Press, Brooks/Cole, Pacific Grove, CA.",
