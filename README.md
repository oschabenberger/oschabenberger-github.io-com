# Communication in Team-Based Data Science

This is material used in designing a course on communications in data science at Virginia Tech.

This material is accompanied by the following

- [Foundations of Data Science--Beyond the Numbers](https://oschabenberger.github.io/oschabenberger-github.io-bn/) (*Foundations*) and

- [Statistical Learning](https://oschabenberger.github.io/oschabenberger-github.io-sl/) (*StatLearning*).

- [Statistical Programming](https://oschabenberger.github.io/oschabenberger-github.io-sp/) (*StatProgramming*).

- [Computational Thinking](https://oschabenberger.github.io/oschabenberger-github.io-ct/).

*Foundations* covers fundamental concepts in data science and the data science project life cycle.
*StatLearning* is a comprehensive collection of modules on supervised and unsupervised learning from a statistical perspective.
*StatProgramming* is a short course about statistical programming concepts in `R`.

The material was developed in Quarto because it combines prose with math and supports multiple programming languages and kernels within the same framework. To learn more about Quarto books visit <https://quarto.org/docs/books>.
