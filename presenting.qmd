## Introduction

In his book about the craft of scientific presentations, @Alley2013
tells the story of Zhengzhi Sheng, a postdoc at the University of
Arkansas. Sheng had discovered a new superconductor, a very big deal
that called for a press conference. Because Sheng was not a good
speaker, the department chair Allen Hermann spoke at the press
conference. Despite Hermann acknowledging the contribution of Sheng, it
was Hermann who would receive most of the accolades for the discovery.

If we cannot effectively present our work as data scientists, we

-   cannot impart new understanding to our audiences,
-   cannot empower stakeholders to make decisions based on our work,
-   cannot get appropriate credit for the work of the individual and the
    team,
-   cannot advance our careers.

Presenting brings together the major forms of communication: speaking words
combines with using written words and visual aids to support the story. A 
possibly great presentation can be derailed by shortcomings in any of these. 
The greatest content does not resonate if it is delivered in a flat tone of
voice, boring, with lots of filler words ("Um", "So", "OK", "Aaaand", "Right", 
"You know"). Slides with too many words distract the audience by reading. Poorly
chosen visualizations leave them puzzled.

Drawing on Aristotle's rhetorical triangle (@sec-comm-models-aristotle),
content (logos) is king and must not be sacrificed by burying it in
extraneous details. But great content delivered without passion (pathos)
misses the impact it could have. If it is obvious that we do not care
about the subject, how can we expect the audience to care? In
presentations of technical content scientists and engineers tend to
place much emphasis on logos, the facts and logical evidence supporting
the assertions. This can work well for an audience of scientists and
engineers but not for a non-technical audience where character (ethos)
and emotional appeal (pathos) are very important.

Presentations have advantages and disadvantages, why give a presentation
if you could communicate by email, write a document, or produce an
online visual essay? In many organizations presentations are common to
share and disseminate information. You might not get a chance to choose
the communication medium and be asked to give an oral presentation.

::: {.callout-note title="Personal Experience" collapse="true"}
I worked for a company where it was customary to hold a monthly
operational meeting. The purpose for the meeting was to provide the
executives an update on a series of high-priority projects in progress
around the company. A project would be part of the operational meeting
at its inception and until it did not need input or oversight from the
executives.

This was a great opportunity to let team members present on the status
of projects in a high-stake, compressed format. You had 5-10 minutes to
reintroduce to the company what the project was about, where it stood,
what worked well and what did not. Then you had to be prepared to take
questions from the senior executives.
:::

Face-to-face presentations have advantages over other forms of
communication that you should be aware of and take advantage of:

-   The speaker can **read the audience**. You can respond to cues from
    the audience. Are they attentive? Do they have a puzzled look on
    their face? Are they distracted? Do certain points or visuals hit
    particularly well?

-   The audience can **read the speaker**. Your authentic passion for
    the topic can be on full display. Some consider this also a
    disadvantage because lack of enthusiasm or poor delivery is also on
    full display.

-   The presenter can **directly engage** with the audience. You can ask
    questions to engage the audience and check their background,
    motivation, and understanding.

-   **Emphasis** through delivery. Important points can be emphasized
    through verbal cues, pausing, creating suspense, tone of voice, body
    language, gestures, etc. Telling a story orally with support of
    visual aids is the most effective way of knowledge transfer.

-   **Witnessing** of information delivery. You know who received the
    information.

Face-to-face presentations have also distinct disadvantages
[@Alley2013]. The information delivery is restricted to the pace of the
speaker. For some audience members this pace is too slow, for others it
is too fast. Unless the presentation is recorded, there is a single
opportunity for the presenter to deliver and for the audience to attend.
The audience cannot verify background information at the time
information is communicated or look up unfamiliar words. Maybe most
important, the success of the presentation correlates with the
presenter's ability to deliver the content.

## Speaking Style

What are the greatest fears regarding oral presentations? To stand in
front of the audience and to forget the words. To look stupid. To get
stuck. To say something incorrect. To not be able to answer questions.
To rely on technology that fails when it counts. To disappoint.

Not knowing what to say or forgetting the words ranks high among the
dread of public speaking. This can be overcome with preparation, but
before you prepare you have to settle how to deliver the words.

Also, never forget that the only person who knows the presentation is
you. If you skip some material this time or add some verbiage next
time---only you will know. The fear of forgetting words is somewhat
irrational if you consider that the audience does not know what you were
going to say.

### Reading

Unless you are on a book tour and reading out loud your latest novel to
an audience, reading the words is a bad idea. It might give you comfort
to look at the text and to see what to say and what comes next. It takes
a lot of training to read text and make it not sound like it is being
read. Politicians, public speakers, and TV moderators who rely on
teleprompters learn to get good at it.

Without such practice, read speech comes across as stilted, the pace is
unnatural, and it undermines the speaker's credibility to seemingly have
to rely on being given the words.

Furthermore, reading words concentrates the speaker's eye on the text
and reduces eye contact with the audience. That reduces engagement.

The worst option is to put the text on slides and read the slides to the
audience. It is amazing how often this presentation style is chosen. One
of three things will happen when you read out loud the material on the
slides

1.  The audience focuses on the text, reads along and the voice of the
    speaker becomes a distraction
2.  The audience ignores the text and focuses on the speaker, who is not
    focused on the audience
3.  The audience tries to focus on both text and speaker which makes
    their head explode because reading and listening have a different
    pace.

All three outcomes are bad.

When relying on slide notes that the audience does not see, make sure
that the presentation technology allows you to see the nodes in a
speaker view. If you rely on those notes for delivery and they are
unavailable, the scaffolding for your talk is gone.

You might think that having the text of the speech available reduces
preparation and rehearsal time. It does not. Being able to present from
text as if you are not reading the text takes enormous practice and
preparation.

::: callout-tip
If you give a recorded presentation to a large audience, you might be
speaking into a camera with a teleprompter. The text is projected onto
the lens of the camera you are looking at or onto a screen mounted close
to the camera lens (@fig-teleprompter).

![On camera teleprompter
system.](images/teleprompter.png){#fig-teleprompter
fig-align="center" width="50%"}

This is a particularly difficult setup. You have a limited field of
vision, you have to look into the camera, you are also looking at the
text you need to deliver, and you have to deliver it as if you are not
reading.

A device that helps make the delivery more natural is to not look
directly at the text and to not stare directly at the camera, but to
move your eyes around the edges of the camera. This appears to the
audience on the other side of the camera as if you are looking around
the room. While looking at the bottom frame, then the side frame, then
the top frame, and the bottom frame again, you can glance at the words
on the teleprompter. Then *all* you have to do is deliver those words as
if you had not read them.
:::

### Memorization

On the other spectrum from relying on seeing the actual text of the
speech is memorization of the speech. This delivery style has advantages
and disadvantages too.

Like reading, the text is precise and identical every time the speech is
given. The speaker seems immediately credible for their recall of
complex material. They appear to *really know their stuff*.

However, speaking from memory comes with pitfalls. What if you do not
remember the words? The environment in which you memorize and rehearse
is likely very different from the environment in which you deliver the
presentation. When your body floods with adrenaline at the beginning of
the speech, bright lights are shining in your eyes, and all eyes are on
you, will you remember every word?

When speaking from memory, the pace can be unnatural and the speech can
appear too rehearsed and fake. An audience question can throw you off,
there is no opportunity to make adjustments to the speech on the fly.

### Off the Cuff

Also known as **impromptu** speech, you are delivering without
preparation and without additional aids such as notes, cue cards,
comfort monitors, or teleprompters.

Impromptu speech is the polar opposite of reading text. You are
freewheeling it. The material is flexible and can be adjusted on the
fly, it will be (slightly) different every time. There is typically no
outline unless the impromptu speech provides it as part of the oratory.
The audience might not be sure where you are going.

The potential for disaster is high with this delivery form.

### Extemporaneous Speech

**Extemporaneous** speaking simply means delivering a well-rehearsed
speech without memorizing every word based on an outline of the
material. It is the speaking style we recommend you should adopt.

When speaking extemporaneously, the pace and delivery is natural and the
content is similar but not identical. The audience knows the outline of
the talk and understands the broad strokes. You can adjust the pace and
wording on the fly if necessary.

Speaking extemporaneously takes much practice and preparation. You
commit to memory the outline of the talk and generate the words on the
spot, even under pressure. Cue cards or notes can help you keep track of
the outline and important points you need to make, without providing the
exact wording.

When using slides, only a small fraction of the text appears on the
slides. The slide content helps both speaker and audience to follow the
organization of the talk.

When using note cards, leave them in your pocket or at the podium. Do
not carry them around and look at them. This undermines the credibility
of the speaker. It is OK to silently look at the notes, but while
speaking to the audience the notes should be out of the way.

::: {.callout-note title="Personal Experience" collapse="true"}
I attended a presentation by noted journalist and biographer Walter
Isaacson some years ago. He presented on one of his latest book
"Innovators", a book about the creation of computing and the internet.
It was a great speech---I think.

He had notes written out in longhand and just before stepping on stage
he slipped them into the inside pocket of his jacket. Or so he thought.
He had missed the pocket and the pages were now held by only friction
between the two sides of the jacket. As he moved around the stage the
pages tried more and more to to escape from the jacket. The audience was
captivated, following the journey of the note pages, until they finally
dropped to the floor. That is all I remember from the speech.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

An end-to-end presentation can involve multiple delivery styles. The
overall style can be extemporaneous but you might choose to memorize the
first few sentences and the end. You can show and read quotes to make
sure they are quoted precisely. When answering questions you use
impromptu speech.

### Preparation and Rehearsal

::: {.callout-note title="Personal Experience" collapse="true"}
I was scheduled to give a 11-minute presentation about artificial
intelligence from the main stage of a large user conference to about
5,000 attendees. In preparing for the talk I was informed that several
comfort monitors would be mounted near the edge of the stage; someone
would scroll the text of my speech from the production area (essentially
teleprompters).

The speech was made more complex because I decided to give it while
roaming back and forth across the stage on a hands-free [Segway
Ninebot](https://store.segway.com/ninebot-s2). This was symbolic of
being assisted by technology---we are driving it, it is not driving us.
Clever, eh?

I prepared for the talk by rehearsing it on the 45-minute loop walking
around a lake in the neighborhood. I could fit three to four deliveries
into a loop every other day. Rehearsing meant speaking it out loud,
folks were probably scratching their head when they saw me talking
loudly about artificial intelligence while exercising.

Separately, I practiced on the Segway.

By the time of the presentation the teleprompting on the comfort
monitors was not necessary. It was reassuring to know that the text was
there should I need to be reminded. Because of the many rehearsals
talking out loud, this was just another one of those occasions giving
the speech. I could concentrate on not driving the Segway off the stage.
:::

When you attend an enjoyable 20-minute presentation, you do not see the
hard work and preparation that made the presentation enjoyable. Creating
and delivering great presentations takes time. Even creating and
delivering good or average presentations takes time.

Regardless of which speaking style you use, you have to prepare for it
and the preparation must match the style. For example, giving great
unrehearsed, impromptu speeches is very difficult and requires skill and
preparation. You have to organize the material on the fly, construct
stories as you go, be in total command of the material, and engage the
audience without the help of other aids.

You might be required to read text when a comfort monitor or
teleprompter is used and have to prepare and rehearse to deliver with a
natural tone and pace despite reading.

Most speakers are under-prepared rather than over-prepared.

::: {.callout-note title="Personal Experience" collapse="true"}
I was fortunate to have an office next to a professor who had won the
highest teaching awards at the university. Having taken courses from him
myself as a student I remembered the carefully chosen class material,
the clever derivations that let us *see the light*, and the masterful
oral delivery.

When I later joined the university as an assistant professor, our
offices were next to each other. Before every lecture, even for a course
he had taught many times before, he rehearsed the lecture in his office
by speaking out loud important parts of the content. That meticulous and
dedicated preparation contributed to his teaching excellence.
:::

Preparation and rehearsal also reduces the chances that Murphy's Law
strikes.

#### Murphy's law

Named after aerospace engineer Edward A. Murphy, Jr., the law is quoted
as

> *Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.*

> *If something can go wrong, it will.*

> *If there is a possibility of several things going wrong, the one that
> will cause the most damage will be the one to go wrong.*

A corollary of the last law is that if something can go wrong at a worse
time it will happen then.

Examples of Murphy's law in presentations are many. As you can imagine,
these failures are mostly not unforeseeable events you are powerless
against. Most of the times they are foreseeable problems that you did
not anticipate and did not prepare for.

-   The presentation works great on your laptop but you are presenting
    from someone else's device that is lacking the necessary fonts.

-   A demo crashes because the presentation machine does not have the
    right software installed.

-   A presentation relies on access to the internet, but that is not
    available when presenting from a client's conference room.

-   The internet bandwidth does not support the download speed needed to
    run an animation smoothly.

-   No sound

-   The projector overheats and goes into cooldown mode in the middle of
    the presentation.

-   You forgot to enable screen sharing on the Mac for the specific
    video hosting technology.

-   The demo that worked well every time in rehearsal produces really
    strange results when it matters, because you did not set a random
    number seed that would make the demo reproducible.

-   The poster presentation looked great on the computer screen but what
    comes back from the printing center has wonky spacing of paragraphs
    and graphics. The layout is completely off.

::: {.callout-note title="Personal Experience" collapse="false"}
Here are some examples where Murphy's law struck presentations I gave or
attended and lessons learned.

1.  **This happened**. An executive gave a demonstration of social media
    analytics to the CEO, producing word clouds of the topics most
    talked about on Twitter (as it was called back then). The technology
    worked great, the problem was that they queried Twitter live at the
    time of the demo, and whatever threads they pulled were discussing
    some X-rated topics. The word cloud produced from that data was
    memorable.\
    **Lesson**. If you use real-time data in a demo, get a copy of the
    data first, so you know what you are dealing with. Especially when
    pulling data from the internet, it can be an unfriendly place. Save
    the data to some place and stream it from there to the application.
    This is still a live, real-time demo, but it is repeatable. Let the
    audience know that this is what you are doing.

2.  **This happened**. A candidate for a teaching position gave a test
    lecture that involved a live Python demo. The machine learning model
    he was lecturing about was applied to a small data set to facilitate
    training during class---nothing wrong with that. However the results
    of the analysis were not meaningful and did not support the points
    he was trying to make.\
    **Lesson**. Random number generators affect statistical results that
    depend on random numbers in some form. Many data science tasks
    invole random numbers. The effect of different random number streams
    is particularly striking with small data sets and small sample
    sizes, situations that are common in demos that are designed to make
    a point. Make sure you fix the random number stream by setting a
    seed in a demo that depends on randomness.

3.  **This happened**. We were rehearsing a large on-stage presentation
    to several thousand attendees of a software conference. The
    presentation was also being streamed live to a worldwide audience.
    The presentation involved four individual live demos by developers
    of the particular aspect of the software. It was a big deal for the
    developers to be asked to present their work on such a stage. They
    had all worked very hard on the presentations, we had rehearsed a
    number of times at company headquarters. The planning and
    preparation for such an event takes months. The on-stage rehearsal
    also went very well, no glitches or hiccups, everybody was on top of
    their material. We needed internet for the software to work and had
    brought our own corporate network to the venue so we could hardwire
    all machines. That is preparation!\
    \
    The next day, when it counted, the second or third demo in the
    lineup did not work at all. It was like the internet was not working
    for that machine. The developer tried to fix things but was not sure
    what was going on---while thousands were watching in real time. As
    moderator of the show I had to improvise and move on, not being able
    to cover that part of the show. The developer was mortified and
    embarrassed. To this day I am not sure whether he ever recovered
    from this experience.\
    \
    **What went wrong?** During on-stage rehearsal the developer forgot
    to plug in the Ethernet cable for the corporate network into his
    laptop. He had run over WiFi and that had worked. After rehearsal,
    the stage was sequestered and all machines remained on stage for the
    show in the morning. The machine thus did not get another change to
    be plugged into the network. While WiFi worked fine during rehearsal
    with just a few folks in the room, it broke down when thousands of
    attendees brought their laptops and smart phones into the room.\
    **Lesson**. Even after the most meticulous preparation there is
    something that can get overlooked. If you have multiple things, like
    multiple laptops in this case, are they all the same? Be prepared to
    improvise.

4.  **This happened**. A presentation in a hotel ballroom to about 100
    attendees. A small production area in the back of the room handled
    projection on two large screens, microphones, etc. In the middle of
    the presentation the mic dies and the screens go black. The onstage
    laptop shows the presentation but everything else is dead.\
    **What went wrong?** The cables that ran from the front of the
    room---where the screens were located---to the production area in
    the back were supposed to be covered and taped to the floor. You
    don't want folks to trip over cables or cables come unplugged. It so
    happened that just under a desk in the production area the main
    cable feeding power to the stage was extended by another cable and
    the two sides had not been taped down. As an engineer moved his feet
    he knocked the connection loose and the room went dark.\
    **Lesson**. Be prepared to improvise.
:::

Preparation helps reduce the chances that presentations derail. In
several of the examples, live demos were involved and that adds a
certain risk. Many eschew running anything live for fear that things
could go wrong. I have always loved demoing things live, running
software in real time, analyzing real data during presentations. It
makes presentations more interesting, more dynamic, and more real.

My advice is not to drop demos and live material and to be prepared for
the occasional hiccup when things do not work. For example, have a video
of the demo handy (stored locally on your machine) that you produced
ahead of time. If the technology does not work for the live demo, show
the video.

Almost all live elements in presentations worked for me. The few that
failed in some way are not reason enough to give up on it.

## Mistakes

@Alley2013 lists many critical errors in scientific presentations. These
also apply to presenting data science content. We summarize some
mistakes here unless they have been covered elsewhere in this chapter.

1.  **The Wrong Speech**. You might be giving the wrong speech if you
    are ...

    -   Not targeting the audience
    -   Not grasping the purpose of the presentation
    -   Not considering the occasion of the presentation
    -   Not considering the format of the presentation (bringing slides
        to a roundtable)

2.  **Boring the Audience**. "Are you not entertained?" To avoid the
    stinging criticism of a boring presentation, remember storytelling.

    -   Make connections with the audience
    -   Engage the audience emotionally
    -   Use metaphors and analogies to relate concepts
    -   Be passionate
    -   Tell stories
    -   Do not overwhelm the audience with details

3.  **Covering too Much**. If you spend 80% of the project doing X, it
    does not mean you should spend 80% of the project presentation
    talking about X. Overwhelming the audience with too much content is
    bad, as is covering content at too great a depth. You should start
    the presentation at the level of knowledge of your audience. If the
    goal for the audience is to learn, then you take them from their
    existing level of knowledge to a higher one. The difficulty is
    assessing their knowledge accurately.\
    \
    Too many presentations try to convey all the work that has been done
    rather than address what the audience wants and needs. If the
    audience does not want or need to learn, why give a lecture?\
    \
    Imagine the amount of information the audience can consume as the
    area of a rectangle, the sides represent the **scope** (or breadth)
    of the talk and the **depth** at which the scope is covered. Shorter
    talks, or talks to audiences with less pre-existing knowledge work
    with a smaller area. Now you need to decide how to arrange that area
    into scope x depth (@fig-scope-depth). Less scope at greater depth
    or greater scope at lesser depth.
    A wider scope touches on more topics and allows the audience to
    connect with *something* in the talk.

    ![The amount of information covered as a function of scope and
    depth](images/scope_and_depth.png){#fig-scope-depth
    fig-align="center" width="70%"}
    

4.  **Losing the Audience at the Start**. Make the beginning of the
    presentation as clear and engaging as possible. Moving on from a
    title slide too fast or an outline slide that would help the
    audience mentally organize the topic is a recipe for losing the
    audience at the start. If there are no opportunities to ask
    questions or to get feedback, you might not get them back.

5.  **Losing the Audience along the Way**. It is easy for the audience
    to fall behind during presentations, even when the presentation is
    carefully structured. They do not have the luxury to go back and
    look at something a second time or to take a time out and think
    about what was just said. By the time they are done contemplating a
    point the speaker made, the presentation has moved on and increased
    the gap between speaker and audience./ / An audience that falls
    behind is getting lost. To minimize the chances of losing the
    audience you can use a few devices. Mak sure the audience knows the
    destination of the presentation. Remind them during the presentation
    where they are now relative to the destination. The old adage "Tell
    them what you are going to tell them. Tell them. Then tell them what
    you just told them" applies here. Avoid going off topic or
    tangential ruminations. Make sure the audience knows when you are
    speculating, presenting straw-man proposals, and when you are
    stating facts. Let the audience know when the presentation is
    transitioning from the beginning to the middle and to the end
    (remember the ABT formula). Pause at transition points to allow the
    audience to collect their thoughts and catch up with you.

6.  **PowerPoint (or Google Slides or ...)**. The use of presentation
    software such as Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides is common and
    often expected. Unfortunately, it is not a good format to transfer
    knowledge as we know from the discussion of storytelling
    (@sec-story-telling). Jeff Bezos, founder and former CEO of Amazon,
    famously disallowed the use of PowerPoint at Amazon.\
    \
    If you use PowerPoint-style software in presentations, we recommend
    the assertion--evidence format for slides. A headline-style title
    provides the assertion of the slide, the important message being
    conveyed. The remainder of the slide consists of few bullets (if
    any) and visuals that provide evidence of the assertion.\
    \
    The default slide layouts offered by PowerPoint are not necessarily
    good presentation aids. If you have a title slide, dress it up with
    an image that connects to the presentation, rather than showing the
    title of the talk and the speaker affiliation. Short talks do not
    need an outline talk, if you add an outline, think of a format
    different from a bullet list. Try to get away from bullet lists as
    much as you can. How about an assertion or simple sentence centered
    on the slide as the only element?

::: {.callout-tip title="Personal Experience"}
During my time in the corporate world, the visual aids in my
presentations changed greatly; from the typical sequence of bullet lists
to slides that contain a single image, filling the entire area, with a
single term or to slides that contained only a few words to help
with organizing a topic. @fig-analytics-econ and @fig-five-trends are examples of 
this design philosophy.

![A "typical" presentation slide.](images/AnalyticsEconomy.png){#fig-analytics-econ
fig-align="center" width="70%"}

![Presentation slide organizing a topic.](images/FiveTrends.png){#fig-five-trends fig-align="center" width="70%"}


While the slide is shown, I present on the topic displayed as text. The
format is visually engaging but keeps the audience focus on the speaker.
They are not distracted by text on the slides or what else is going on
with the slide, except for taking in the image. Since a slide might stay
up for several minutes, the audience has time to connect the elements of
the background image with the presentation. A downside of this approach
is the need for high-quality images. And you need to know your
presentation, the slides are not much help to the speaker to recall the
material.

A nice side effect of adopting this design, no one has ever
requested to use my slides in their presentations. Ha! 😄
:::

7. **Not Paying Attention**. There is much that a communicator needs to pay
attention to and failure to do so can derail a communication effort. As a presenter,
you need to pay attention to the environment, the audience, the technology, 
and to yourself. A separate chapter is dedicated to *Paying Attention* (@sec-attention)
because there is so much to it.

## Presenting over Video

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, presenting over video has become
commonplace.
